    <h2>Project description</h2>
    Speech processing is increasingly done via end-to-end rather than modular models: 
    this makes is hard to understand what is causing the modelâ€™s decisions in general 
    and specifically why it fails when it does. In the context of Automatic Speech 
    Recognition (ASR), end-to-end typically means that the spectrogram is the input, 
    and the transcription is the output. Other types of end-to-end speech models cover an 
    even larger range distance between the input and output: 

    <ul>
      <li>visually grounded models start with the speech signal and end with visual-semantic embeddings; 
      <li>spoken language translation systems start with the speech signal in the source language and end with the text in the target language; 
      <li>spoken command understanding start with the speech signal and end with a structured representation of the information conveyed in the utterance.
    </ul>  
Given the opacity of such end-to-end models, it is desirable to develop and test methods for analyzing the 
        intermediate representations they learn, and interpreting the decisions they make. The objective of 
        this WP is to develop and test methods for manipulating intermediate representations learned by 
        end-to-end speech-understanding models in order to make it possible for users to debug them, 
        to  control them, and explain their output.
