<h3>1. INTERTEXTUAL PERSPECTIVE ON LITERATURE</h3>
         
   <h4>1.1. 
    GENERAL REMARKS</h4>
   
   <p>In this chapter the idea of 
    intertextuality and its application to literary studies will be briefly 
    discussed. The underlying notion of dialog and its usefulness for analysis 
    of narrative texts will also be presented. References will be made mainly 
    to the work of Mikhail Bachtin, which is fundamental in this area, and 
    to Julia Kristeva, who develops his ideas.</p>
   
   <h4>1.2.
          DIALOG AND INTERTEXTUALITY</h4>
   
        <p>Intertextuality is a word 
          coined by Julia Kristeva in an essay on Bachtin written in 1966. The 
          coinage has been since used by many authors in a variety of more or 
          less differing meanings (Morace 1989: 7). Kristeva uses this term to 
          denote the interdependence of literary texts. She describes a text as 
          a "mosaic of quotations, an absorption and transformation of another 
          text" (Kristeva 1983: 396). This perspective is a development of Bachtin's 
          idea of the dialogic nature of the "word". Analyzing the phenomena of 
          parody and stylization Bachtin talks about the two-directionality of 
          the word. In parodic and stylized texts it is directed simultaneously 
          towards the speaking subject and towards another word, towards the speech 
          of others - without being aware of this it is impossible to understand 
          properly parodic or stylized text; they would be taken to be simple 
          instances of non-metalinguistic utterances instead of being interpreted 
          as comments on other texts (Bachtin 1983: 320). This condition of the 
          word in parody and stylization is only an especially flagrant case. 
          Bachtin argues that all word is essentially dialogic. It has been passed 
          from mouth to mouth, it has been used in different context and with 
          different intentions. And the traces of all these contexts, intentions 
          and conflicting voices are present in the word. There are no neutral 
          words, all words are an effect of long dialogic intercourse. It is impossible 
          to use the word innocently as if it has not been used before by others 
          (Bachtin 1983: 331-332).</p>
        <p>The idea of the word as a 
          dialog makes it possible to view the structure of a literary text not 
          as something given, but as a dynamic relation to other structures. The 
          literary text is to be analyzed as a dialogic relationship of several 
          elements such as the writing subject, the addressee, the past and present 
          cultural context. This dialog, on Kristeva's analysis, has two axes: 
          the horizontal one (subject - addressee) and the vertical one (text 
          - context) (1983: 394-396). What is of most relevance for our purposes 
          is the vertical axis - intertextual dialog. Such is also the most widely 
          used meaning of intertextuality. It is something that happens <i>between</i> 
          a text and other texts. Since words have always already been used, and 
          modified by those multiple uses, a text can only be a modification of 
          what has already been written. </p>
        <p>One approach to intertextual 
          interpretation of a text would include the traditional study of sources, 
          the looking for influences. But it would not limit itself to establishing 
          the literary models, the sources, of the text - it would explore the 
          play of meaning between the text and these sources (Alzaraki 1984: 282-283). 
          </p>
        <p>A more radical procedure is 
          to explore the play of meaning between a text and other texts that are 
          not its sources in any straightforward way. The precursor of intertextuality, 
          Borges, does something like this in "Kafka y sus precursores" (1988: 
          203-205). He finds Kafkaesque motives in a heterogeneous set of texts 
          (beginning with Zenon's paradox about the impossibility of movement). 
          These texts are all quite different and the motives they share would 
          not be perceived if Kafka had not written his own texts.</p>

       
         
           
             
              <blockquote> 
                <p>[C]ada escritor <i>crea</i> 
                  a sus precursores. Su labor modifica nuestra concepci�n del 
                  pasado, como ha de modificar el futuro.</p>
                <p>(Each writer creates 
                  his precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past 
                  as it should modify the future.) (Borges 1988: 205)</p>
              </blockquote>
            
          
        
      

        <p>It is thus possible to read 
          Gustave Flaubert in light of what was written later by Marcel Proust 
          (Barthes 1973: 59). Under this perspective the assumptions underlying 
          the traditional pre-modernist study of sources are left out. The presence 
          of an author who makes conscious, intentional references to the literary 
          tradition, filling his or her text with citations and literary allusions 
          is no longer presupposed (cf. Matsuba 1997). The focus is on the texts 
          themselves and on their endless dialog; on the way they refer to one 
          another; include one another; transform one another; influence the reading 
          of one another and interact in other ways. In confrontation with this 
          intertextual intercourse the notion of the writing subject is gradually 
          obliterated (Kristeva 1983: 398). And that is why a vast collection 
          of texts, a library, is such a well-suited setting for fictions that 
          explore intertextuality.</p>
