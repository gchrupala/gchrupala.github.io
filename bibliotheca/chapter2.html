        <h3>2. 
          WRITING IS REWRITING, LIVING IS RELIVING</h3>
        <h4>2.1.
          GENERAL REMARKS</h4>
  
  <p>      "Novels", 
          as the protagonist of <i>The British Museum is Falling Down</i> claims, 
          have "just about exhausted the possibilities of life" (<i>BM</i>: 118). 
          The narrator of the preface to <i>Il nome della rosa</i> tells us that 
          what we are going to read is a "storia di libri", story of books, not 
          of "miserie quotidiane" (<i>NR</i>: 15). Could the latter statement 
          be offering a solution to the problem posed by the former? And how is 
          it related to the uneasiness manifest in the prologue to Borges's Ficciones: 
          "Desvarío laborioso y empobrecedor el de componer vastos libros (A laborious 
          and impoverishing madness to write vast books)"?(<i>F</i>: 12) How come 
          in the tree books alluded to the libraries are so important? If Borges 
          is correct, the answers to these questions already exist, hidden in 
          some library, in all libraries; what remains to be done is to find them 
          and print them in one place: "A scholar is just a library's way of making 
          another library" (Dennet 1991: 202).</p>
     <h4>2.2
          THE DROPPING OF THE MIMETIC ILUSION</h4>
  <p>
        The general 
          observation that insinuates itself is the complicated tangle of relations 
          between life and literature, i.e. reality and textuality, to be found 
          in the fictional works of Borges, Lodge and Eco. The initial hitch is 
          that of having to study to the life-to-fiction connections in, and as 
          expounded in, works of fiction themselves. Still, it is rather apparent 
          that narratives can, on the one hand, attempt to create worlds as close 
          as possible to the <i>actual</i> world and, on the other hand, they 
          can dispel this mimetic illusion even as they create it, and thus admit 
          their indebtedness to other works of fiction. Borges is explicit: </p>
         
           
             
     <blockquote>          
                <i>No 
                  soy el primer autor de la narración </i>La biblioteca de Babel<i>:

  <p>            
            
          
        
        In this story, 
          like in most others, Borges almost completely renounces the pretence 
          of reflecting life - as Adam Appleby would say, "there is no risk of 
          confusing that sort of thing with life, of course" (<i>BM</i>: 118). 
          But with novels it is different, he claims: "you might pick a book at 
          any time and read about an ordinary chap called Joe Smith doing just 
          the sort of things you did yourself" (ibid.). Thus, a mimetic novel, 
          dealing with realistic characters, creates a very strong illusion of 
          reality. The same applies even to such self-conscious and autothematic 
          narratives as Lodge's and Eco's. </p>
     
     <h4>2.3.
          LIFE AND FICTION IN THE 
          MUSEUM</h4>
<p>
        <i>The British 
          Museum is Falling Down</i> 
          recounts one day from the life of a Catholic postgraduate student Adam 
          Appleby, as in the British Museum Reading Room he tries to advance his 
          Ph.D. on "The Structure of Long Sentences in Three Modern English Novels", 
          getting into all sorts of preposterous situations, while his wife Barbara, 
          taking care of the rest of their "alphabetical family": Clare, Dominic 
          and Edward (Morace 1989: 132), frets at home about he overdue period, 
          wondering whether the shortcomings of the "Vatican Roulette" they use 
          as contraception are going to present them with a fourth, impossible 
          descendant. </p>
<p>        Adam's vicissitudes 
          are related in a collage of styles parodying the modernist novels he 
          is himself investigating, but a casual reader can follow the intrigue 
          undisturbed. The novel is "a concatenation of voices transformed into 
          a seemingly sequential and apparently seamless narrative" (Morace 1989: 
          135), the echolalia and mimicry lurk under the surface of a deceptively 
          transparent storytelling. As Morace observes, "in Lodge's . . . novel, 
          realism and parody, life and literature, feed on and reflect each other 
          creating a comical but nonetheless disturbing confusion of realms" (1989: 
          133). A particularly immediate example of such mirror-play is offered 
          in the episode where the adolescent Virginia finally allows Adam to 
          read Merrymarsh's unpublished manuscript, and she expects him to have 
          sex with her in exchange:</p>
         
           
<blockquote>             
               
                At 
                  this point the story broke off. . . . It was a great pity. <i>Robert 
                  and Rachel</i> wasn't quite a literary work of art: it was feeling 
                  crude and unrefined, turned out clumsily from the rough moulds 
                  of real experience. There was a kind of embarrassment, a shamefulness 
                  in the confessions, from which no detail was spared, of a man 
                  whose sexual desire was ignited for the first time at the very 
                  moment when his sexual vigour was declining. It wasn't really 
                  art . . . but it was unquestionably the best thing Egbert Merrymarsh 
                  had ever done. That description of the young girl, for instance, 
                  standing nude in the tin tub, her hair falling to her waist... 
                  As Adam turned back to read the passage again, the manuscript 
                  was snatched from his hands.
   <p>             'That's 
                  quite enough,' said Virginia.</p>
      <p>          Adam's 
                  protest died in his throat. Virginia was sitting beside him, 
                  quite naked. (<i>BM</i>: 141)</p>
              
            
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        
        Adam wants 
          to re-read a passage from a book "turned out clumsily from the moulds 
          of real experience" but what happens instead is that he has to re-live 
          a version of this paper-mediated experience. How life mirrors fiction 
          and vice versa may be mad, but there is a method in this madness. A 
          method that Adam, confused as he may be, is able to detect, having read 
          most of the narratives that shape his experience: </p>
         
       <blockquote>    
             
               
                So 
                  all of us, you see, are really enacting events that have already 
                  been written about in some novel or other. Of course, most people 
                  don't realize this - they fondly imagine their little lives 
                  are unique... Just as well, too, because when you <i>do</i> 
                  tumble to it, the effect is very disturbing. (<i>BM</i>: 118-119)
              
            
          </blockquote>
    <p>
        
        He even tries 
          to distinguish life and literature: "Literature is mostly about having 
          sex and not much about having children. Life is the other way round" 
          (<i>BM</i>: 56).</p>
       <p> He spends 
          his day in and around a library full of fictions and "'his perceptions 
          of life around him become increasingly phantasmagoric'" (Morace 1989: 
          136; quoting Jackson). Finally he comes home to spend the night with 
          his Penelope/Molly-like wife and their three children and to once again 
          taste life: a real life they try to tailor so that it suits the exigencies 
          of the various calendars, charts and temperature graphs of the Rhythm 
          Method - yet another fiction taking over their lives? (Morace 1989: 
          140). The constant clash and confusion between the fiction-ridden life 
          of a scholar and the family-ridden life of a husband provides the structural 
          scheme of the novel. In an episode echoing Henry James's <i>Turn of 
          the Screw</i>, Adam has a vision of his lost-in-fog, apparition-like 
          family come to see him at the Museum - he is sure what he saw cannot 
          have been real.</p>
         
           
             
          <blockquote>     
                Although 
                  the Museum was notoriously a place where you eventually met 
                  everyone you knew, this law didn't include dependants. Scholarship 
                  and domesticity were opposed worlds, whose common frontier was 
                  marked by the museum railings. This reversal of the natural 
                  order, with himself outside the railings, and his family inside, 
                  was a vision pregnant with symbolic significance if only he 
                  could penetrate it. (<i>BM</i>: 96)

          <p>
        
        Earlier in 
          the novel, in a lengthy passage (parodying DH Lawrence this time), the 
          Museum Reading Room, with its spherical form, is compared to a huge 
          womb where the process of knowledge gestation is going on, and the "foetus-like 
          scholars" enclosed in their warm world of books are contrasted with 
          their wives living outside lives: </p>
         
           <blockquote>
             
               <p>
                They 
                  [scholars] curled themselves more tightly over their books, 
                  for they did not want to leave the warm womb . . . </p>
<p>                But 
                  the women who waited outside felt differently. . . . From their 
                  dingy flats in Islington and cramped semis in Bexleyheath they 
                  looked out through the windows at the life of the world . . 
                  . and they found [it] good. And they resented the warm womb 
                  of the Museum which made them poor and lonely, which swallowed 
                  up their men every day and sapped them of their vital spirits 
                  . . . (<i>BM</i>: 44)</p>
              </blockquote>
            <p>
          
        
        The worlds 
          of scholarly studies and of everyday life are seen as incompatible and 
          hostile. Those dealing with texts, Adam among them, are isolated in 
          the library - an enclave of textuality in the surrounding realm of daily 
          life. Those who belong to life rather than to literature (and they tend 
          to be female) never come to the library and are resentful and suspicious 
          of it. Mrs. Green, Adam and Barbara's landlady, thinks it highly <i>unnatural</i> 
          for an adult man to spend his day reading books (<i>BM</i>: 23)- an 
          activity proper maybe for children (but are the foetal students trying 
          to get back to mother's womb anything but children?). </p>
<p>        Nonetheless, 
          the communication between the two worlds, intrusions of one into the 
          other are inevitable: what Adam thinks was a hallucination, was <i>really</i> 
          his family on the other side of the railings. Adam is a student but 
          he is a husband and a father of three, too, and he cannot work properly 
          when he is worried about the situation of his wife and children. Which, 
          due to the uncertainties of 'natural' methods of contraception and the 
          irregularity of Barbara's period, means "once a month at least..." (<i>BM</i>: 
          153)</p>
   <p>     When the scholars 
          are "expelled from the womb" (<i>BM</i>: 45) they take their notes and 
          file cards with bits of the library on them into the outside non-fictional 
          world dominated by women and babies. Adam, peeing in the Readers' lavatory, 
          wonders what will happen if they have another child. How would they 
          accommodate it in the flat?</p>
         
           
      <blockquote>       
               
                It 
                  comprised only two rooms, plus kitchen and bathroom. One of 
                  the rooms had originally been a living-room, but this has long 
                  ago become Adam's and Barbara's bedroom, while the children 
                  occupied the other. This seemed the good and logical design 
                  of a good Catholic home: no room for <i>living</i> in, only 
                  rooms for breeding, sleeping, eating and excreting. As it was, 
                  he was compelled to study in his bedroom, his desk squeezed 
                  up beside the double bed, constant reminder of birth, copulation 
                  and death. (<i>BM</i>: 79)
    </blockquote>
              
            
          
        
    <p>    After this 
          quote from Eliot he goes on in the same vein of wasteland desperation 
          and concludes that "perhaps he could live in the Museum, hiding when 
          the closing bell rang and dossing down on one of the broad-topped desks 
          with a pile of books for a pillow," (ibid.) and thus avoid the interference 
          of life with scholarly research.</p>
       <p> Adam feels 
          the stifling pressure of literature on his life as much as he feels 
          the pressure of life on his study. Throughout the day he is aware of 
          falling into "moulds prepared by literature" (<i>BM</i>: 32) Escaping 
          from Virginia the seductress's room, "as he cautiously descended the 
          ladder he was conscious of re-enacting one of the oldest roles in literature"(<i>BM</i>: 
          145). This uncanny experience is then in turn going to be textualized 
          - a kind of closed circuit of life and fiction - since, according to 
          Barbara, Adam projects to write "a novel where life [keeps] taking the 
          shape of literature, did you ever hear anything so cracked, life is 
          life and books are books and if he was a woman he wouldn't need to be 
          told that." (<i>BM</i>: 157)</p>
        <h4>2.4. 
          EPHEMERAL LIFE OF MANUSCRIPTS AND NARRATORS</h4>
    <p>
        The main part 
          of <i>Il nome della rosa</i>,<i> </i>Adso's da Melk's narrative, is 
          enclosed in a Russian-dolls-like structure. The inner frame is provided 
          by Adso's Prologue, where he explains the circumstances that led to 
          the events he is about to describe: the conflict between the emperor 
          and the Pope, the unaccounted-for death of a monk in the monastery where 
          both sides are to meet and negotiate, and the summoning of his master 
          Guglielmo (i.e. William) da Baskerville, who as a former inquisitor 
          is to help unravel the mystery (which seems to be connected with the 
          labyrinth-like Library and the "libro proibito" it conceals). The outer 
          frame is a preface, whose author tells the story of the manuscript which 
          was put in his hands - as we shall see, a very complicated story indeed. 
          The book ends with a counterpart to the prologue, the "Ultimo folio" 
          - the latter like the former written by Adso as an old man.</p>
<p>        In this last 
          part he describes how, after the fire had destroyed the monastery's 
          library, he collected the scattered, scorched remains of its manuscripts 
          and was (re)reading them throughout his life. Having arrived at the 
          end of the narrative, he confesses:</p>
         
       <blockquote>    
             
               <p>
                .

                  che tu ora leggerai, ignoto lettore, altro non sia che un centone, 
                  un carme a figura, un immenso acrostico che non dice e non ripete 
                  altro che ciò che quei frammenti mi hanno suggerito, né so più 
                  se io abbia sinora parlato di essi o essi abbiano parlato per 
                  bocca mia.</p>
     <p>
      (I 
      almost have an impression that all I have written in those pages 
                  that you are now reading, unknown reader, is nothing but a compilation, 
                  a figurative poem, an immense acrostic which does not say and 
                  does not repeat anything but what those fragments have suggested 
                  to me, neither do I know whether I have spoken of them or they 
                  have spoken through my mouth.) (<i>NR</i>: 502-503)</p>

    <p>
     
          
        
        Saying that 
          much amounts to calling his own reality into question: if the story 
          he has just told is no more than a paraphrase of fragmented texts from 
          a destroyed collection, then anything or anyone inside the story, including 
          the narrator, has no extratextual existence unless supported by some 
          independent evidence. And the higher order narrator, the author of the 
          preface, only further obscures the matters. The text he claims to have 
          translated, a nineteenth century version by a certain abbot Vallet, 
          <i>Le manuscript de Dom Adson de Melk, traduit en français d'après l'édition 
          de Dom J. Mabillon</i>, is accidentally taken away by his companion 
          as she hastily leaves him. The bibliographical references of the lost 
          book prove false - it seems as if it has never existed - and the narrator 
          begins to doubt the reliability of his Italian version. He only decides 
          to publish it when in a Buenos Aires bookstore he comes across ample 
          fragments of Adso's story quoted in another book - an almost equally 
          obscure one: </p>

        This proliferation 
          of bibliography (invented, the reader suspects), the excess of elusive 
          sources apparently corroborating one another, in fact raises doubts 
          about the existential status of both the narrators (Eco's persona in 
          the preface and Adso in the manuscript) and the events they claim to 
          relate as real. As the preface writer admits: </p>
         
       <blockquote>

                A 
                  ben riflettare, assai scarse erano le ragioni che potessero 
                  inclinarmi a dare alle stampe la mia versione italiana di una 
                  oscura versione neogotica francese di una edizione latina secentesca 
                  di un'opera scritta in latino da un monaco tedesco sul finire 
                  del trecento. </p>
        <p>        (Thinking 
                  about it, scarce were the reasons that led me to publish my 
                  Italian version of an obscure neogothic version of a seventeenth 
                  century Latin version of a work written in Latin by a German 
                  monk towards the end of the fourteenth century.) (<i>NR</i>:

        Young Adso's 
          experience, which he relates as an aging man, no longer sure he actually 
          lived it, is then at least three more times re-related in the course 
          of centuries. An episode from his real life - real inside the possible 
          world of his own narrative, as opposed to the "frammenti" saved from 
          the fire, whose contents do not belong to the narrated reality - is 
          taken over and processed by literature until it finally dissolves in 
          the continuum of textuality. Or rather peoples the endless shelves of 
          the world's libraries. </p>
       <p> The same happens 
          to the second order narrator, the preface writer, identified with Eco 
          himself by means of the reference to a book by Eco, <i>Apocalittici 
          e integrati</i> (McGrady 1987: 789). He recounts an episode of his life 
          connected with the manuscript and this becomes a part of the novel and 
          is interpreted as fiction. And it happens in part because of what the 
          real Eco does, saturating the preface with intertextual allusions, between 
          others to Borges's "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" or giving it the weird-sounding 
          title "Naturalmente, un manuscritto" thus admitting that the novel and 
          the preface have other texts as their source rather than any real events 
          (McGrady 1987: 788-796). Real-life experience is textualized, but it 
          also proves to have sprung from text in the first place. </p>

          TEASING EXISTENCE OF VIRTUAL TEXTS</h4>

        <i>The British 
          Museum</i> features 
          Wilde's witticism that "life imitates art" for an epigraph, and life 
          as represented in this book, as well as in <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, 
          certainly does follow patterns derived from other books, and neither 
          Eco nor Lodge try to conceal it. </p>
       <p> The Holmesian 
          William of Baskerville and his disciple "Adso (Adson, Watson)" (Nadin, 
          1987: 117) are involved in an intrigue closely parallel to that in "La 
          muerte y la brújula" (a story from <i>Ficciones</i>) (McGrady: 797-803). 
          If Adso is right in thinking that all he has told is nothing more than 
          a re-elaboration of what was already written and hidden in the monastic 
          Library, then Sherlock Holmes and Lönnrot from the story by Borges, 
          or a version of them, must have been present there as well. Borges would 
          probably agree; in fact that's what he does mentioning Leucippus, Aristotle 
          etc. as the original authors of his "Library of Babel".</p>
<p>        Adam has a 
          similar insight: if only the file cards with text he had extracted from 
          the library could somehow be put in the correct order, his dissertation 
          would write itself (<i>BM</i>: 160). He is especially attracted to stationery 
          shop displays: </p>
         
           
   <blockquote>          
               
                He 
                  coveted the files, punches, staplers, erasers, coloured inks 
                  and gadgets whose functions remained a teasing mystery, thinking 
                  that if only he could afford to equip himself with all this 
                  apparatus his thesis would [again] write itself: he would be 
                  automated. (<i>BM</i>: 70)
              
        </blockquote>
    <p>
          
        
        Adam's thesis 
          seems, from these two mentions, just on the verge of (coming to) existence. 
          It is already there, one of the possible orderings of pre-existent words, 
          of ready made (long) sentences, of thought-before ideas; just like <i>The 
          Name of the Rose</i> is already present in the books of the library 
          that appears on its pages. Just like Adams's life, and Adso's and William's, 
          centered around the Library - around the British Museum or around the 
          Edifice - have already been lived, already written about.</p>
