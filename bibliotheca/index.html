    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>The library 
     is to be found as an element of a lot of cultural products. In narrative 
     literature it is especially frequent. Victorian detective fiction is 
     chockfull of mysterious libraries and librarians (Garret 1991: 376). 
     In: <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/resources/libraries/gslis/bibliomysteries.html">http://www.simmons.edu/resources/libraries/gslis/bibliomysteries.html</a> 
     over seven hundred literary texts in which libraries or librarians play 
     some literarily significant role are listed. Among this multitude of 
     fiction riddled with libraries there are some where the library is central 
     to the narrative functioning of the text in question. Perhaps the most 
     widely known fictional library is the one in <i>The Name of the Rose.</i> 
     In Umberto Eco's 1980 novel (and in its 1986 film version) the huge 
     medieval monastic library is the text�s symbolic object par excellence 
     (Gritti 1991: 104-105). The library serves as a model of intertextual 
     universe � i.e. the source of this novel and all literature. Like everything 
     in this book, the library is also extracted from other texts: in general 
     it derives from all the tradition of bibliomystery (a fiction where 
     mysterious things happen in a library setting), but more directly it 
     is a version of the universal library from Borges's "La Biblioteca de 
     Babel" (<i>F</i>: 89-100; see <a href="appendix.html">appendix</a>). 
     Echoing Jorge Borges, Eco names his evil librarian "Jorge de Burgos" 
     because "one pays ones debts", as he says in a postscript to <i>The 
      Name of the Rose</i> (<i>NR</i>: 515).</p>
    <p>The intertextual 
     dialog between <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and Borges's short stories 
     has been pointed out by the majority of the novel's critics. Ossola 
     discusses the various sources of the "rose" in Eco's novel and quotes 
     Borges's poem "La Rosa profunda" as one of them (Ossola 1984: 482-483). 
     Nadine (1987: 115-131) mentions Jorge Borges, together with a variety 
     of other authors, throughout his informal article, omitting full references 
     and generally defying style guides: this strategy is part of the point 
     the article makes: <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, and the rest of literature 
     (and criticism) is a result of texts talking to themselves rather than 
     authors creating and controlling them. Bondanella (1997: 101-104) in 
     the chapter devoted to <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, apart from calling 
     the attention to the general indebtedness of Eco to Borges, also sees 
     parallels in their views on detective fiction as one of the most ordered 
     and structured genres. McGrady's article deals specifically with Borges's 
     influences on <i>Il nome della rosa</i> (1987: 787-807). He discovers 
     echoes of the various <i>Ficciones</i> stories in the novel. "Tl�n, 
     Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" provides the model for the confused bibliographical 
     references of the preface and "La Biblioteca de Babel" is reincarnated 
     in the monastic library. He then focuses on the parallelisms between 
     the novel's intrigue and the structure of "La muerte y la br�jula". 
     Garret (1991: 378-384)comments more specifically on the role of the 
     library in Eco's novel. He comments on the omnipresence of Borges and 
     his fiction as sources for the novel's preoccupation with libraries, 
     librarians and manuscripts. He sees "La Biblioteca de Babel" as an archetypal 
     library dystopia and as the textual model of the labyrinthine library 
     in <i>The Name of the Rose</i>. </p>
    <p>The re-elaboration 
     of Borges's themes in <i>Il nome della rosa</i> seems a conscious strategy 
     and is apparently fairly obvious to most commentators. There is, however, 
     also a less known novel which enters intertextual dialog with Borges 
     and Eco. It is David Lodge's <i>The British Museum is Falling Down</i> 
     first published in 1965, between the dates of publication of the two 
     other texts.</p>
    <p>It uses strategies 
     of intertextual transformations profusely, being a series of pastiches 
     and parodies of modernist writers, namely Joseph Conrad, Graham Greene, 
     Ernest Hemingway, Henry James, Franz Kafka, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, 
     Fr. Rolfe, C.P. Snow and Virginia Woolf (in author's afterword to <i>BM</i>: 
     168). Little critical attention has been devoted to this novel. Perhaps 
     the treatment most relevant to the present thesis is provided by Morace 
     in a chapter of <i>The Dialogic Novels of Malcolm Bradbury and David 
      Lodge</i> (1989: 132-141). Morace's analysis of this novel (and all 
     the others he deals with) is based on the Bachtinian concept of the 
     dialogic. Using techniques of parody and juxtaposing conflicting voices 
     without authorially resolving the conflict, Lodge puts together a novel 
     which resonates with echoes of disparate styles and appropriating the 
     literary tradition at the same time undermines its authority. And what 
     is of most interest to us, the novel features the British Museum Library 
     in a protagonist-like role.</p>
    <p>This novel 
     and <i>Il nome della rosa</i> differ significantly in many aspects. 
     The former has 160 pages, the latter exceeds 500. The former is an easy-to-read 
     comic academic picaresque, the latter a Latin-laden pseudo-detective 
     story, full of philosophical and theological argument. They nevertheless 
     share the central role the library plays in their plot as well as a 
     number of other recurring motives. These include: </p>

    <ul>

       
     <li>the characters getting 
      lost in labyrinth-like library structures; </li>
     
     <li>the fire menacing or destroying 
      the library and the manuscript; </li>
     
     <li>the pursuit of a lost manuscript 
      by the protagonist; </li>
     
     <li>the presence, in the world 
      outside the library, of a young woman seducing the protagonist. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To my knowledge these correspondences 
     have not been pointed out or accounted for. This may be partly due to 
     the fact that they do not seem to spring from any direct influence of 
     Lodge's novel on Eco's work (unlike the explicitly acknowledged references 
     to Borges). In the present thesis, after a short chapter presenting 
     the most relevant ideas of intertextual theory, elements common to the 
     three texts, and especially to the two novels, will be analyzed in some 
     detail. Following some of the existing accounts of the library motive 
     in fiction, the perspective of intertextuality will be adopted in order 
     to arrive at an interpretation of the observed correspondences. </p>
    <p>It will be claimed that the 
     library as a literary motive reappears in the texts examined because 
     it serves perfectly to illustrate and narrativize the relations of fictions 
     to reality and to other fictions. Among its many other possible meanings, 
     the library is principally an embodiment of the concept of intertextuality 
     as anticipated by Borges and Bachtin, and elaborated by Julia Kristeva, 
     Roland Barthes and other theorists. An attempt will be made to demonstrate 
     how the novelistic practice in <i>Il nome</i> and <i>The British Museum</i> 
     is not only an illustration but also an application of the theories 
     alluded to. It will also be argued that the least popular of the three 
     texts, <i>The British Museum</i>, can be read as anticipating and avant 
     la lettre parodying the library motive as present in <i>Il nome della 
      rosa</i></p>
