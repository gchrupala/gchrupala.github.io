   <h3>3. RECURRING 
    MOTIVES</h3>
   <h4>3.1 
    GENERAL REMARKS</h4>
   
   <p>The three texts dealt 
    with in the present thesis share the library as a significant element 
    of narration. The actions of the protagonists take place inside or around 
    the library. It architecturally dominates the setting and metaphorically 
    the signification of these texts. 
   </p> <p>It also seems to attract 
    other co-occurring motives and generate a set of common elements tending 
    to appear together. The ones singled out and discussed in detail in 
    this chapter are the following: </p>
   
   <ol type="i">
    <li> library:
     
     <ul>
      
      <li> as a universe</li>
      <li> as a temple and 
       as a forbidden place</li>
      <li> as a labyrinth</li>
      
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     
     fire menacing the 
     library</li>
    <li> lost manuscripts</li>
    <li> female character 
     distracting the male protagonist from scholarly pursuits.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The last point will also 
    lead us to some more general considerations of sex and gender as present 
    in those texts. 
   </p>
   <h4>3.2. 
    LIBRARY</h4>
   <h5>3.2.1. 
    AS A UNIVERSE</h5>
   <p>In the fictional world of the Borges 
    story "La Biblioteca de Babel" there is nothing apart from the library. 
    It occupies the whole universe. </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    <p>
     El universo (que otros llaman 
     la Biblioteca) se compone de un número indefinido, y tal 
     vez infinito, de galerías hexagonales . . . 
    </p> <p>(The universe (which others 
     call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite 
     number of hexagonal galleries . . .) (F: 89). 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    All the inhabitants of the universe are 
    librarians and the narrator is one of them. All the world is just books 
    and their keepers. The narrator proceeds with the architectural description 
    of this world: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     galerías . . . con 
     vastos pozos de ventilación en el medio, cercado por barandas 
     bajísimas. La distribución de las galerías 
     es invariable. Veinte anaqueles, a cinco largos anaqueles por 
     lado, cubren todos los lados menos dos; su altura, que es la de 
     los pisos, excede apenas la de un bibliotecario normal. Una de 
     las caras libres da a un angosto zaguán, que desemboca 
     en otra galería, idéntica a la primera y a todas. 
     A izquierda y a derecha del zaguán hay dos gabinetes minúsculos. 
     Uno permite dormir de pie; otro, satisfacer las necesidades fecales. 
     Por ahí pasa la escalera espiral, que se abisma y se eleva 
     hacia lo remoto. En el zaguán hay un espejo, que fielmente 
     duplica las apariencias. . . . La luz procede de unas frutas esféricas 
     que llevan el nombre de lámparas. Hay dos en cada hexágono: 
     transversales. La luz que emiten es insuficiente, incesante. 
    </p> <p>(galleries, with vast air 
     shafts in the middle, surrounded by very low railings. From 
     any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and 
     lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. 
     Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides 
     except two: their height, which is the distance from floor to 
     ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal librarian. One of 
     the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens on to another 
     gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the 
     left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. 
     In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy 
     one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, 
     which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. 
     In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates 
     appearances. . . . Light is provided by some spherical fruits 
     which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, 
     in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.) 
     (F: 89-90) </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    
    This realistic presentation of the physical 
    reality of the universe known to the narrator is then completed by a mathematical 
    abstract definition:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     La Biblioteca es una esfera 
     cuyo centro cabal es cualquier hexágono, cuya circumferencia 
     es inaccesible. 
    </p> <p>(The Library is a sphere whose 
     exact centre is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference 
     is inaccessible.) (F: 90). 
    </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
    
    
    
    The books the library contains are all 
    of the same format: "each book is of four hundred and ten pages: each 
    page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black 
    in colour" (F: 91). The letters on the spine do not indicate what is to 
    be found inside. And what is to be found are accidental permutations of 
    the twenty five orthographic symbols: the full stop, the comma, the space 
    and the twenty three letters of the alphabet. The Library is infinite 
    and the librarians have never come across two identical books: as the 
    number of all possible permutations of the twenty five symbols is limited 
    (although extremely vast), it follows that the Library is total. Every 
    possible book in every possible language is hidden in one of its innumerable 
    hexagons. The Library contains everything, e.g.: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    <p>
    la historia minuciosa del 
    porvenir, las autobiografías de los arcángeles, 
    el catálogo fiel de la Biblioteca, miles y miles de catálogos 
    falsos, la demostración de la falacia de esos catálogos, 
    la demostración de la falacia del catálogo verdadero, 
    el evangelio gnóstico de Basílides, el comentario 
    de ese evangelio, el comentario del comentario de ese evangelio, 
    la relación verídica de tu muerte, la versión 
    de cada libro a todas las lenguas, las interpolaciones de cada 
    libro en todos los libros. 
   </p> <p>(the minutely detailed history 
     of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful 
     catalogue of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, 
     the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration 
     of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of 
     Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on 
     the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, 
     the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations 
     of every book in all books.) (F: 94) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    When the fact that the Library must include 
    everything was demonstrated by one of the librarians the humanity was 
    initially overwhelmed by happiness: "there was no personal or world problem 
    whose eloquent solution did not exist" (ibid.). The universe and the existence 
    of all people was vindicated. Then, when it was becoming to seem more 
    and more apparent that the rule in the Library was chaos and meaning an 
    extremely rare exception, the people/librarians began to despair. At the 
    time when the narrator is scribbling his account on a book cover, the 
    population of the Library has already been decimated by suicides, pulmonary 
    diseases, epidemics and a general despair. He thinks the human species 
    is on its way to extinction and what will stay on is the library: "illuminated, 
    solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, 
    useless, incorruptible, secret" (F: 99). This accumulation of rhetorical 
    adjectives applies to the same library as the initial realistic description 
    with all its drabness. The Library is a metaphorical textual universe, 
    but it is also a place where librarians live, sleep, defecate and die, 
    and where their body is then thrown down one of the ventilation shafts 
    and, falling interminably, decomposes. Although, as Adam might say, "there 
    is no risk of confusing that sort of thing with life" (BM: 118) as we 
    know it, the world created in this ficción has enough realist detail 
    to almost make it credible as an alternative reality (we will see in section 
    3.5. 
    why only almost). 
   </p> <p>The other two libraries 
    dealt with in here appear in novels rather than <i>ficciones</i> and 
    as such they are much more of this world. They retain, however, a lot 
    of the figurative function so evident in "The Library of Babel". 
   </p> <p>The library in <i>Il 
     nome della rosa</i> belongs to a fourteenth century north Italian monastery. 
    Or rather the monastery belongs to it, since the Library is its most 
    important point; more important even than the church. It is situated 
    on the highest, third floor of the Edifice which towers above the surroundings. 
    Arriving, Adso is overwhelmed by its size: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     Come ci inerpicavamo 
     per il sentiero scosceso che si snodava intorno al monte, vidi 
     l'abbazia. Non mi stupirono di essa le mura che la cingevano da 
     ogni lato, simili ad altre che vidi in tutto il mondo cristiano, 
     ma la mole di quello che poi appresi essere l'Edificio. 
    </p> <p>(As we were 
     climbing up the precipitous which wove its way around the mountain, 
     I saw the abbey. I wasn't amazed by the walls that girded it 
     on all sides, similar to others I saw all over the Christian 
     world, but the hugeness of what as I later learned was the Edifice.)(<i>NR</i>: 
     29) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
    
    
    
    The narrator then proceeds 
    with a description of the architecture of the Edificio, emulating in detail 
    the one provided by Borges. It is a three floor octagonal construction, 
    four of whose sides are occupied by heptagonal turrets. Five of the seven 
    walls of these turrets protrude outside, and the remaining two are hidden 
    inside. The whole building seems tetragonal from the distance. Adso sees 
    a deep symbolic sense in all these numbers: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     otto il numero 
     della perfezione d'ogni tetragono, quattro il numero dei vangeli, 
     cinque il numero delle zone del mondo, sette il numero dei doni 
     dello Spirito Santo. 
    </p> <p>(eight the number 
     of each tetragon's perfection, four the number of Gospels, five 
     the number of the zones of the world, seven the number of the 
     Holy Ghost's gifts.) (ibid.) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    When later on William and 
    Adso work out the mysterious layout of the Library itself, it seems to 
    them that 
   </p>
   <blockquote>

    
    
    la biblioteca 
    è costruita secondo un'armonia celeste a cui si possono 
    attribuire vari e mirifici significati... (the library is build 
    according to a celestial harmony to which various and marvelous 
    meanings can be attributed...)(<i>NR</i>: 220).
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    This looking for sense 
    in the numbers spelled by the Library has a parallel in "La Biblioteca 
    de Babel". Idealists among the librarians (who all spend their life in 
    the endlessly repeating hexagons) claim that 
   </p>   
   <blockquote> 
    
    las salas hexagonales 
    son una forma necesaria del espacio absoluto o, por lo menos, 
    de nuestra intuición del espacio. Razonan que es inconcebible 
    una sala triangular o pentagonal. (the hexagonal rooms are a necessary 
    form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. 
    They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable) 
    (<i>F:</i> 90)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    The Edifice and the Library 
    house encoded in their numbers the medieval notions about Earth and 
    Heaven. The building seems to grow straight from the rock and, becoming 
    naturally a tower reaches the sky, with no discontinuity in between. The 
    tetragon springing from the earth and in three floors reaching heaven 
    reflects the principle of the Christian world: the <i>three</i>-personal 
    God descending from heaven on Earth and revealed in the <i>four</i> Gospels. 
    For Adso, and for the medieval builders of the Abbey, "architecture is, 
    of all arts, the one that most arduously aims to reproduce the order of 
    the universe in its rhythm" (<i>NR</i>: 34). 
   </p> 
   <p>Inside the Edifice, 
    the scriptorium and the library also evoke the principal elements of 
    Christian cosmology. When Adso enters the scriptorium for the first 
    time he is overwhelmed by its celestial beauty. "[L]a sua spaziosa immensit�" 
    (its spacious immensity) is suffused with "bellissima luce" (the most 
    beautiful light) (<i>NR</i>: 79). The windows are made of transparent 
    glass, "perche la luce entrasse di modo pi� puro possibile" (so 
    that the light can get in in a manner as pure as possible) (ibid.). 
    Adso then explains the spiritual significance of this light: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     Vidi altre volte 
     e in altri luoghi molti scriptoria, ma nessuno in cui cos� 
     luminosamente rifulgesse, nelle colate di luce fisica che facevano 
     risplendere l'ambiente, lo stesso principio spirituale che la 
     luce incarna, la <i>claritas</i>, fonte di ogni belleza e sapienza, 
     attributo inscindiblile di quella proporzione che la sala manifestava. 
    </p> <p>(On other occasions 
     and in other places I saw many scriptoria, but none where the 
     very spiritual principle that light incarnates, <i>claritas</i>, 
     source of all beauty and knowledge, indispensable attribute 
     of the proportion manifested by the hall, would shine so luminously 
     in the streams of physical light which made the place resplendent) 
     (<i>NR</i>: 79-80) 
     
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   
   <p>
    This lukewarm, heavenly 
    light reigning in the scriptorium is complemented by the darkness of the 
    library upstairs. At the beginning this darkness is only slightly dissipated 
    by the light of oil lamps exuding hallucinogenic smoke and by scary reflections 
    in curved mirrors. But finally, when diabolic Jorge sets it on fire the 
    library becomes a true netherworld: "dall'accesso alla biblioteca proveniva 
    un fumo denso . . . non si poteva pi� penetrare in quell'inferno" 
    (a thick smoke was coming out from the entrance to the library . . . it 
    was no more possible to penetrate that inferno) (<i>NR</i>: 490). Thus 
    the Library in <i>The Name of the Rose</i> impersonates the two extremes 
    of the Christian universe: heaven and hell. It is illuminated by the light 
    of knowledge and beauty but then is burned to the ground by the blazes 
    of hellfire (cf. Garret 1991: 379). 
   </p> 
   <p>The Library is analogous 
    to the Universe (and to the Library of Babel) also in other aspects. 
    Not being infinite it is still very big. The Edifice is higher even 
    than the very church (<i>NR</i>: 45), and the Library is talked about 
    with admiration by all the Christian world (<i>NR</i>: 43). Not without 
    a reason, since compared with its bookshelves "quelli di Bobbio o di 
    Pomposa, di Cluny o di Fleury sembrano la stanza di un fanciullo che 
    appena si inizii all'abaco" (those of Bobbio or of Pomposa, of Cluny 
    or of Fleury seem a bookshelf belonging to a boy just being initiated 
    to the abacus) (ibid.). Indeed it is so much bigger than any of the 
    real medieval libraries that it is virtually impossible for it to have 
    existed (Garret 1991: 375). This fact reinforces the non-literal reading 
    of the library in the context of the book. 
   </p> 
   <p>The monks who live in 
    the monastery and work with the manuscripts in the Edifice come from 
    all over the Christian world: there are Germans, Danes, Spaniards, Frenchmen 
    and Greeks among them (<i>NR</i>: 43-44). The monastery is a micro-world 
    containing a figure of the real world: the spatial layout of the Library 
    corresponds to that of the "universo mondo" (<i>NR</i>: 316). 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     [L]a biblioteca 
     era davvero distribuita secondo l'immagine dell orbo terraqueo. 
     A settentrione trovammo ANGLIA e GERMANI, che lungo la parete 
     occidentale si legavano a GALLIA, per poi generare all'estremo 
     occidente HIBERNIA e verso la parete meridionale ROMA . . . e 
     YSPANIA. Venivano poi a meridione i LEONES, l'AEGYPTUS che verso 
     oriente diventavano IUDEA e FONS ADAE. Tra oriente e settentrione, 
     lungo la parete, ACAIA . . . per indicare la Grecia . . . 
    </p> <p>([T]he library 
     was really arranged according to the image of the globe. In 
     the North we found Anglia and Germani, which along the western 
     wall joined Galia, to later generate Hibernia in the extreme 
     West and, towards the southern wall, Roma . . . and Yspania. 
     Then, in the South, there came the Leones, the Aegyptus which 
     towards the East became Iudea and Fons Adeae. Between the East 
     and the North, along the wall, Acaia . . . indicating Greece 
     . . .)(<i>NR</i>: 323-324) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
    
    
    
    Being a figure of the universe 
    the Library also partakes of another of its features. The narrator of 
    "La Biblioteca de Babel" claims that the Library exists <i>ab aeterno</i>, 
    has always existed. Adso does not go that far, but still attributes a 
    respectable age to the Edifice: "era molto pi� antico delle costruzioni 
    che lo attorniavano (it was much older than the surrounding constructions)" 
    (<i>NR</i>: 34). The Abbot of the monastery insists that the monks have 
    worked there "per secoli" (for centuries), have upheld the library "nei 
    secoli" and its design has remained unknown to everybody "nei secoli" 
    (<i>NR</i>: 45-46). 
   </p> <p>But now, he continues, 
    sharing millenarian pessimism with the narrator of "La Biblioteca de 
    Babel", the times are close: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     [V]iviamo ora 
     in tempi molto oscuri . . . Per i peccati degli uomini il mondo 
     sta sospeso sul ciglio dell'abisso, penetrato del abisso stesso 
     che l'abisso invoca. . . . Mundus senscit. . . . La divina providenza 
     ha ordinato che il governo universale, che all'inizio era in oriente, 
     man mano che il tempo si avvicina si spostasse verso occidente, 
     per avvertirci che la fine del mondo si approssima, perché 
     il corso degli avvenimenti ha già raggiunto il limite dell'universo. 
    </p> <p>(We are now 
     living in very dark times . . . Because of men's sins the world 
     is hanging on the edge of the abyss, as the abyss penetrates 
     those who invoke it. . . . Mundus senescit. . . . The divine 
     providence has ordered that the universal government, which 
     at the beginning was in the East, should shift towards the West 
     as the time closes on, in order to warn us that the end of the 
     world is approaching as the course of events has already reached 
     the limits of the universe) (<i>NR</i>: 44-45) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    In "The Library of Babel" 
    the librarians may all die but the library will stay on, as it has always 
    stood. Here the library is very old but not eternal, and, the monks intuit, 
    it will soon disappear and the world with it. The monks tend to identify 
    the destiny of the world with what happens to the library. Since literacy 
    decreases and monastic libraries lose their importance, the world must 
    be coming to an end. For Jorge, the approaching end is to be read in the 
    signs "nel grande anfiteatro del mondo, e nella immagine ridotta dell'abbazia" 
    (in the great amphitheater of the world and in the reduced image of the 
    abbey) (<i>NR</i>: 404). Adso observes that for the rest of the monks 
    an almost total identification of the universe and the library takes place: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     Per questi uomini 
     votati alla scrittura la biblioteca era al tempo stesso la Gerusaleme 
     celeste e un mondo sotterraneo al confine tra la terra incognita 
     e gli inferi. 
    </p> <p>For these men 
     vowed to writing the library was at the same time the heavenly 
     Jerusalem and a subterranean world at the boundary between the 
     terra incognita and hell. (<i>NR</i>: 187) 
     
     
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    From the above examples 
    one can see that although in <i>Il nome della rosa</i> the library is 
    not as total as in Borges's story it is still pretty evident that it is 
    to be taken as more than a simple fourteenth century library. It is a 
    microcosm which is a replica of the medieval European cosmos: it is Heaven, 
    Earth, and Hell. It stands for a world which is "un libro scritto dal 
    ditto di Dio, in cui ogni cosa parla dell'immensa bont� del suo 
    creatore" (a book written by God's finger, where each thing speaks of 
    the immense goodness of its creator) (<i>NR</i>: 282). In such a world 
    everything is a sign � just as everything is potentially a sign in the 
    modern world, too. 
   </p> 
   <p>Unlike in the two other 
    texts, the library in the Lodge novel, apart from performing a narrative 
    role in the book, is also a part of the extratextual reality. <i>The 
     British Museum is Falling Down </i>being a patchwork of pastiche and 
    parody, the non-literal meaning of the British Museum Library is never 
    very stable. But in spite of its protean nature some patterns can be 
    found - and quite a few correspondences with the libraries from the 
    other two texts. 
   </p>
   <p>The British Museum Library 
    is also a microcosm. A cosmological interpretation can be read into 
    elements of its topography. The central part of the library, the Reading 
    Room (an equivalent of the scriptorium from <i>Il nome della rosa</i>) 
    is covered by a huge dome which hangs "over the scene like a tropical 
    sky before a storm" (<i>BM</i>: 52). In one moment the "dome looked 
    down on the scholars" (<i>BM</i>: 44). Forty five pages later, during 
    the fire alarm, "[t]he dome seemed to look down with deep disapproval 
    at the anarchic scene" (<i>BM</i>: 89). The dome's anxious gaze may 
    be read as a caricature of benevolent God's eye hanging in the sky. 
    And instead of the celestial "most beautiful light" permeating the scriptorium 
    in Eco's novel, in the British Museum Reading Room "[l]ittle daylight 
    entered through the grimy glass at the top", and the scholars "fed on 
    electric light" (<i>BM</i>: 44-45) - a situation more like in Borges's 
    library-universe with its "incessant, insufficient" light. 
   </p>
   <p>The Library also has 
    its quasi-hell. Adam accidentally opens a secret door and "he was in 
    another country: dark, musty, infernal. . . . The staircase spiralled 
    up unto darkness, like a fire escape in hell, fixed there to delude 
    the damned" (<i>BM</i>: 90-91). The titles he finds on the bookshelves 
    there speak of ultimate things: "A bundle of old tracts caught his eye. 
    <i>Repent!</i>, the cover admonished <i>for the Day of Judgement is 
     at Hand</i>." (<i>BM</i>: 91). 
   </p>
   <p>In the British Museum 
    we do not find the exact mapping of the world onto the library layout 
    like in <i>The Name of the Rose</i>. However Adam, from the height of 
    a gallery running round the Reading Room finds a meaning to its design: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    Never before 
    had he been so struck by the symmetry of the reading room design. 
    The disposition of the furniture, which at ground level crated 
    the impression of an irritating maze, now took on the beauty of 
    an abstract geometrical relief - balanced but just complicated 
    enough to please and interest the eye. Two long counters extended 
    from the North Library entrance to the centre of the perfectly 
    circular room. These two lines inclined towards each other, but 
    just as they were about to converge they swelled out to form a 
    small circle, the hub of the Reading Room. Around this hub curved 
    the concentric circles of the catalogue shelves, and from these 
    circles the radii of the long desks extended almost to the perimeter 
    of the huge space. A rectangular table was placed in each of the 
    segments. It was like a diagram of something - a brain or a nervous 
    system, and the foreshortened people moving about in irregular 
    clusters were like blood corpuscles or molecules. This huge domed 
    Reading Room was the cortex of the English-speaking races, he 
    thought, with a certain awe. The memory of everything they had 
    thought or imagined was stored here. (<i>BM</i>: 92-93)
   </blockquote>
   
   <p>       
    
    This huge all-inclusive 
    library, apart from being an illustration of the information flow and 
    storage in the Anglophone world, also is a home for all sorts of scholars 
    from every part of the globe. If the monastic library in Eco's novel is 
    a Mecca for medieval monks from the whole Christianity, then The British 
    Museum performs a similar function in the modern world. There are 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    earnest, efficient 
    Americans, humming away like dynamos, powered by Guggenheim grants; 
    turbanned Sikhs, all called Mr Singh, and all studying Indian 
    influences on English literature; pimply, bespectacled women smiling 
    cruelly to themselves as they noted an error in somebody's footnote; 
    and then the Museum characters � the gentleman whose beard reached 
    to his feet, the lady in shorts, the man wearing odd shoes and 
    a yachting-cap reading a Gaelic newspaper with a one-stringed 
    lute propped up on his desk, the woman who sniffed. (<i>BM</i>: 
    45)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Later on Adam also meets 
    "Indians and Africans working busily in their striped suits and starched 
    collars" (<i>BM</i>: 52), "a prostrate nun, saying her rosary" and "a 
    Negro priest, hurriedly collecting his notes on St Thomas Aquinas". 
   </p> <p>The British Museum as 
    presented in the Lodge novel is not an elaborated figure of the Cosmos 
    like the medieval library for Adso. It is rather a series of comic travesties 
    which build up to a caricature mini-world. Both novels, however, make 
    use of this cultural topos - library as a universe - and play with it, 
    each in a different key. As we have already seen "La Biblioteca de Babel" 
    may be considered the fullest and most explicit elaboration of this 
    specific topos - a textual universe par excellence. 
   </p>
   <h5>3.2.2. 
    AS A TEMPLE AND AS A FORBIDDEN PLACE</h5>
   
   <p>Library, like a temple, 
    is a special place. What is inside is clearly different from what stays 
    outside. Access to a library, as to an altar, is not free for everyone. 
    Library is also a place designated to store and preserve knowledge. 
    Some kinds of knowledge are not to be freely disseminated, they are 
    to be defended against a profane gaze. 
   </p>
   <p>In the Borges story 
    this distinction between the inside and the outside of the library is 
    of course impossible: there is no outside. The space of the library 
    cannot be sacralized. But the texts it contains may become objects of 
    cult - or of inquisition. The narrator affirms: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     Yo conozco distritos 
     en que los jóvenes se prosternan ante los libros y besan 
     con barbarie las páginas, pero no saben descifrar una sola 
     letra. 
    </p> <p>(I know of districts 
     in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and 
     kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know 
     how to decipher a single letter.) (<i>F:</i> 99) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   
   
   <p>
    The knowledge hidden in 
    those books is unattainable for the worshippers; they assume its presence 
    but are unable to decipher it. Other people watch out for heresies: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     Otros, inversamente, 
     creyeron que lo primordial era eliminar las obras inútiles. 
     Invadían los hexágonos, exhibían credenciales 
     no siempre falsas, hojeaban con fastidio un volumen y condenaban 
     anaqueles enteros: a su furor higiénico, ascético, 
     se debe la insensata perdición de millones de libros. 
    </p> <p>(Others, inversely, 
     believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. 
     They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not 
     always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned 
     whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless 
     perdition of millions of books.) (<i>F:</i> 96) 
     
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    Thus books are simultaneously 
    objects of ignorant worship and of inquisitorial furor. 
   </p> <p>In <i>Il nome della 
     rosa</i> the library is quite obviously a very special place. As it 
    has already been observed, architecturally, the monastic church cedes 
    its importance to the library. For the monks work with books in the 
    scriptorium is a form of prayer. They often get a dispensation from 
    church services to be able to go on with their pious work. When at the 
    end of the novel the library is being destroyed by fire, at first they 
    cannot believe that it is really happening: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     
     A tutta prima 
     nessuno comprese. I monaci erano così adusi a considerare 
     la biblioteca come un luogo sacro e inaccessibile, che non riuscivano 
     a rendersi conto che essa fosse minacciata da un accidente volgare, 
     come una capanna di contadini. 
    </p> <p>(At first, nobody 
     understood. The monks were so used to considering the library 
     as a sacred and inaccessible place that they didn't manage to 
     realize that it was now being menaced by a vulgar accident, 
     like a peasant shack) (<i>NR</i>: 489) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    The library is "un luogo 
    sacro e inaccessibile" - and its condition as a holy place depends on 
    its inaccessibility. To a temple an element of mystery is indispensable. 
    This very mysteriousness is one of the causes its final destruction: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    
    La biblioteca 
    era stata condannata dalla sua stessa impenetrabilità, 
    dal misterio che la proteggeva, dall'avarizia dei suoi accessi. 
    (The library had been condemned by its own impenetrability, by 
    the mystery that protected it, by the scarcity of its entrances.) 
    (<i>NR</i>: 492)
   </blockquote>
   
   
   <p>     
    The mysteries protecting 
    the library are many. Monastic rule forbids access to anyone but the librarian 
    and his assistant. This formal prohibition is reinforced by its secret 
    design revealed also to the librarians only. 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     La biblioteca 
     è nata secondo un disegno che è rimasto oscuro a 
     tutti nei secoli e che nessuno dei monaci è chiamato a 
     conoscere. Solo il bibliotecario ne ha ricevuto il segreto dal 
     bibliotecario che lo procedette . . . E le labbra di entrambi 
     sono suggelate dal segreto. Solo il bibliotecario . . . ha il 
     diritto di muoversi nel labirinto dei libri . . . 
    </p> <p>(The library 
     was born according to a design that has remained unknown to 
     all during centuries and which none of the monks is sanctioned 
     to know. Only the librarian has received its secret from the 
     librarian that preceded him . . . And the lips of both are sealed 
     with secrecy. Only the librarian . . . has the right to move 
     around in the labyrinth of books . . .) (<i>NR</i>: 45) 
     
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   
   
   <p>     
    In the monastery, it is 
    not the library that serves the readers � it is the readers that serve 
    and protect the library. The librarian and his assistants who are initiated 
    to its secrets, are the priests of this temple of knowledge. The post 
    of the librarian is as (or more) important as that of the abbot. The two 
    share the spiritual and temporal power in the abbey. 
   </p> <p>The library has also 
    other defenses against unwelcome intruders. The abbot affirms that nobody 
    apart from the librarians could penetrate its secrets: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    <p>       
     Nessuno deve. 
     Nessuno può. Nessuno, volendolo, vi uscirebbe. La biblioteca 
     si difende da sola, insondable come la verità che ospita, 
     ingannevole come la menzogna che custodisce. 
    </p> <p>(Nobody should. 
     Nobody can. Nobody, wanting to, would get out of there. The 
     library defends itself on its own, unfathomable like the truth 
     it houses, deceptive like the lie it guards.) (<i>NR</i>: 46) 
     
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   
   <p>        
    The monks are made to believe 
    that the library is impenetrable for the uninitiated. The librarians use 
    various tricks to scare them off. At night, strange lights appear in the 
    third-floor windows of the Edifice. The monks talk of "fuochi fatui o 
    delle anime dei bibliotecari monaci traspassati che tornano a visitare 
    il loro regno" (fatuous fires or dead librarians' souls that come to visit 
    their kingdom) (<i>NR</i>: 98). Other tell how a disobedient monk who 
    ventured into the library saw "serpenti, uomini senza testa, e uomini 
    con due teste" (snakes, men with no head, and men with two heads). He 
    left the labyrinth almost mad (<i>NR</i>: 97). Adso himself experiences 
    those visions when he and William penetrate the labyrinth. They also feel 
    mysterious presences and hear groans: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     [M]i sentii 
     accarezzare sul volto da una mano invisibile, mentre un gemito, 
     che non era umano e non era animale, eccheggiava e in quel vano 
     e in quello vicino, come se uno spettro vagasse di sali in sala. 
    </p> <p>(I felt an invisible 
     hand stroke my face, while a groan that was not human and was 
     not animal, echoed in that room and in the neighboring one, 
     as if a ghost wandered from room to room(<i>NR</i>: 97) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    They discover that all 
    these things have a rational explanation: "questo luogo della sapienza 
    interdetta � difeso da molti e sapientissimi ritrovati" (this place 
    of forbidden wisdom is defended by many and very wise devices) (<i>NR</i>: 
    179). It results that the visions are provoked by hallucinogenic oil-lamps 
    and reflections in curved mirrors; and the scary sounds and ghostlike 
    touches are simply gusts of air running through the library's clever ventilation 
    system. 
   </p>
   <p>The portrayal of the 
    library that Eco gives in <i>Il nome della rosa</i> is a clear dystopia: 
    the library's task is to preserve knowledge from those curious rather 
    make it available. According to Garret, Eco is thus making a criticism 
    of libraries as "institutions still clinging to an outdated, quasi-sacred 
    mission, urgently in need of a secularizing reform" (1991: 337-338). 
    Undoubtedly, the temple-of-knowledge image of the library is taken to 
    its absurd extreme in the monastery - and it is a constant object of 
    criticism by progressive William. 
   </p>
   <p>The British Museum Library 
    should in this respect be regarded as a reformed, modernized "temple" 
    - like a modern church open and welcoming to those in need of spiritual 
    comfort. It retains traces of its sacral nature , however, (often become 
    mock-sacral) and a lot of its institutional paraphernalia. Chapter three 
    of <i>The British Museum</i>, when Adam at least gets there on his scooter, 
    opens with an invocatory epigraph from Thackeray. The passage represents 
    the sort of attitude to this library that is parodied throughout the 
    novel: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    I have seen 
    all sorts of domes of Peters and Pauls, Sophia, Pantheon - what 
    not? - and have been struck by none of them as much as by that 
    catholic dome in Bloomsbury, under which our million volumes are 
    housed. What peace, what love, what truth, what happiness for 
    all, what generous kindness for you and for me are here spread 
    out! It seems to me one cannot sit down in that place without 
    a heart full of grateful reverence. I own to have said my grace 
    at the table, and to have thanked Heaven for this my English birthright, 
    freely to partake of these bountiful books and to speak the truth 
    I find there. (<i>BM</i>: 34)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    This quote chockfull of 
    religious imagery and pious reverence is polemically and comically set 
    against what happens in the rest of the book - and in the paragraphs immediately 
    following. Having arrived, Adam has difficulty finding where to park his 
    scooter: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    many businessmen 
    have discovered that by leaving their cars in the South forecourt, 
    walking through the Museum and sneaking out through the North 
    Door, they could enjoy free parking all day in the centre of London. 
    (ibid.)
    
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Thus what was supposed 
    to be a privilege of those studious in this great sanctuary of western 
    civilization is being abused by the mercantile infidels - businessmen. 
    Later on even the genuineness of scholars' interest in study is called 
    into question: "The British Museum was returning to its winter role - 
    refuge for scholars, post-graduates and other bums and layabouts in search 
    of a warm seat" (ibid.). Adam is feeling guilty - for him the daily visits 
    to the Museum are a bore. 
   </p>
   
   <blockquote>      
    It seemed base, 
    somehow, to come daily to this great temple of learning, history 
    and artistic achievement in the same weary, mechanical spirit 
    as the jaded clerk to his city office. But there it was: not even 
    the British Museum was proof against the sedation of routine. 
    (<i>BM</i>: 35)
   </blockquote>
   
   
   <p>     
    Adam repeats his tedious 
    daily pilgrimage to the Museum, so he is a familiar figure for the doorkeepers, 
    and, as one initiated, has the privilege of not having to show his card 
    on entering. This gives him an air of importance in the profane eyes of 
    "the group of casual visitors who invariably hung about outside the door, 
    trying to peer into the Reading Room" (ibid.). That day, however, is the 
    day of the annual check and as his card results two months out of date, 
    he is asked to renew it. Now begins a nightmarish procedure that illustrates 
    how the library is hermetic to card-less outsiders. 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    Adam dropped 
    his bags with an angry thud at the feet of an Easter Island god, 
    and stumped off to renew the ticket. Near the Elgin Marbles was 
    a heavy door, guarded by a stern-looking porter with a huge key. 
    When notified of Adam's errand, this official grudgingly unlocked 
    the door, and ushered him into a long corridor. He then rang a 
    little bell, and went out again, <i>locking the door behind him.</i> 
    Adam, or A as he would now more vaguely have identified himself, 
    had been all through this before, but could not be sure whether 
    he had dreamed it or actually experienced it. He was trapped. 
    . . . (<i>BM</i>: 35-36)
   </blockquote>
   <p>          
    
    And the Kafkaesque bureaucratic 
    <i>cauchemare</i> goes on for three more pages: A (like K) passes along 
    long corridors, arrives at huge counters and tries to convince hostile 
    officials ("'Yes?' he [the official] said, after a few minutes had passed, 
    and without looking up" ibid.)to renew his ticket. They try not to understand 
    his request and keep sending him to the other desk. Finally one of them 
    tears his expired ticket into pieces and then there is no way to renew 
    it... Finally, in the corridor, he wakes up from what it seems was a bad 
    dream (but there are scattered pieces of the ticket around him) and is 
    directed again to where Reading Room cards are renewed. 
   </p>
   <p>This experience reminds 
    Adam, and the reader, that the Library is still a powerful holy institution 
    that one does not disregard. There is a clear distinction between the 
    inside and the outside. And to get inside one has to go through a humiliating 
    rite of passage... Clearly this mock-scary episode calls into question 
    and parodies this exclusiveness and inaccessibility, even as it evokes 
    it. The whole fragment is an re-utilization of Kafka clich�s 
    and as such is only half-serious. Adam is not transported by the bliss 
    of being able to partake of the wisdom collected under the "catholic 
    dome" like the Victorian Thackeray, nor is he permanently trapped in 
    the entrails of a menacing Institution like modernist Joseph K. He is 
    rather a postmodern ironic version of these two figures. And Lodge's 
    library is a comic anticipation of the "luogo sacro e inaccessibile" 
    from <i>The Name of the Rose</i>. 
   </p>
   <h5>3.2.3. 
    AS A LABYRINTH</h5>
   
   <p>The libraries in the 
    texts we analyze are all in some way associated with labyrinths or mazes. 
    Their overwhelming architecture makes those who enter get themselves 
    lost inside. The abundance of texts they contain is a sort of labyrinth 
    itself � it is very difficult for the uninitiated to find their way 
    about and usually only librarians fully master the cataloguing systems. 
   </p>
   <p>Architecturally, the 
    library-universe from Borges's story is definitely a labyrinth. One 
    can visualize the arrangement of its innumerable hexagonal rooms as 
    superimposed honeycomb layers. What makes this relatively simple structure 
    a labyrinth is the fact that, apparently, each hexagon-room communicates 
    directly with only one other room on the same floor: four of the six 
    walls are covered by bookshelves, and of the remaining two one connects 
    with another identical hexagon by a narrow hallway (<i>F:</i> 89). Supposing 
    by extension that the other empty wall also opens onto another identical 
    hexagon one gets a pattern which allows for all galleries on one floor 
    to be mutually connected in a quite mazelike manner. But if we assume 
    that any room communicates directly with only one other room on the 
    floor, the picture gets much more confused: in order to access some 
    distant hexagon on the same floor one would have to go up and downstairs 
    many times, perhaps visiting many different floors. 
   </p> <p>As well as physically, 
    the Library is also figuratively a labyrinth, standing for the labyrinthine 
    nature of the world. The universe in this story has the disorderly-ordered 
    shape that physical labyrinths have. The 'order' is represented by the 
    invariable and symmetrical arrangement of the galleries, the bookshelves, 
    by the standardized book formats and the uniform number of letters. 
    The 'disorder' rules in the content of the books: one of them "es un 
    mero laberinto de letras, pero la p�gina penultima dice <i>oh 
     tiempo tus pir�mides</i>" (is a mere labyrinth of letters, but 
    the penultimate page says <i>Oh time your pyramids)</i> (<i>F:</i> 92). 
    Other books do not even say that much. Looking for meaning, looking 
    for "el catálogo de catálogos" (<i>F:</i> 90) is as sensible 
    or senseless as in the real world. One has a small chance of coming 
    across it, but how does one recognize it as the true one? One of the 
    most distinctive features of a labyrinth is the facts that wherever 
    you are in it, it always looks the same to you: all the rooms and all 
    the passages are identical. A similar thing happens to texts in "The 
    Library of Babel". They are different from one another but any book 
    has thousands and thousands of versions and there is no way to tell 
    which is the 'original', the 'true' one. 
   </p> <p>Just like the Borges 
    universe, the library in <i>The Name of the Rose </i>is a "labirinto 
    spirituale e anche labirinto terreno" (spiritual labyrinth and also 
    an earthly one) (<i>NR</i>: 46). It also stands for the labyrinth of 
    the world. It can be inferred that similar rules have to be applied 
    to get around in a labyrinth and in the intricacies of the real world. 
    The oldest monk in of the abbey maintains: 
    
   </p>        
   <blockquote><p>      
     'Hunc mundum 
     tipice laberinthus ille,' . . . 'Intranti largus, redeunti sed 
     nimis artus. La biblioteca � un gran labirinto, segno del 
     labirinto del mondo. . . .' 
    </p> <p>(The library 
     is a great labyrinth, a sign of the labyrinth of the world. 
     . . .) (<i>NR</i>: 163) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   <p>
    
    Its architecture is reminiscent 
    of the Library of Babel (McGrady 1987: 796). The latter like the former 
    is composed of a number of bookshelf-lined multilateral rooms forming 
    together a perplexing maze. Access from one room to another is not always 
    straightforward. The doors are arbitrarily placed so as to confuse the 
    intruders. But the arrangement of rooms is almost as symmetrical as in 
    the Library of Babel. Adso and William discover the design: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     
     Provai tracciare 
     il disegno che il mio maestro mi suggeriva e lanciai un grido 
     di tronfo. 'Ma allora sappiamo tutto! . . . La bibliteca ha cinquantasei 
     stanze, di cui quattro eptagonali e cinquantadue pi� o 
     meno quadrate, e, di queste, otto sono senza finestre, mentre 
     ventotto danno sull'esterno e sedici sull'interno! . . . ' 
    </p> <p>I tried to draw 
     the design that my master was suggesting and shouted in triumph. 
     'But now we know everything! . . . The library has fifty seven 
     rooms, of which four are heptagonal and forty two more or less 
     square, and, out of these, eight are without windows, while 
     twenty eight look out on the outside and sixteen on the inside! 
     . . . (<i>NR</i>: 220) 
    </p></blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    This harmonious pattern 
    looks so perfect on a map. But as soon as one enters inside the library 
    one is unable to find the exit. William explains why: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     'Splendida scoperta,' 
     dissi, 'ma allora perché è così difficile 
     orientarsivi?' 
    </p> <p>'Perché 
     ciò che non risponde a nessuna legge matematica è 
     la disposizione dei varchi. Alcune stanze consentono il passagio 
     a più altre, alcuna a una sola, e c'è da chiedersi 
     se non vi siano stanze che non consentono il passagio a nessuna. 
     Se consideri questo elemento, più la mancanza di luce 
     e il nessun indizio fornito dalla posizione di sole (e vi aggiungi 
     le visioni e gli specchi), capisci come il labirinto sia capace 
     di confondere chiunque lo percorra, giù agitato da un 
     senso di colpa. . . . Il massimo di confusione raggiunto con 
     il massimo di ordine: mi pare un calcolo sublime. . . .' 
    </p> <p>('Excellent 
     discovery,' I said, 'but then why is it so difficult to find 
     one's way?' 'Because what doesn't correspond to no mathematical 
     law is the arrangement of doors. Some rooms allow to pass to 
     other rooms, some to only one other room, and one wonders whether 
     there are no rooms that allow to pass to no other room. If you 
     consider this element, plus the lack of light and no indication 
     given by the position of the sun (and if you add the visions 
     and mirrors), you understand how the labyrinth is capable of 
     confusing whoever visits it, already shaken by a sense of guilt. 
     . . . The maximum of confusion joined with the maximum or order: 
     it seems to me a sublime calculation. . . .') (ibid.) 
     
    </p></blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    The same principle applies 
    in the libraries in Borges and Eco - the same as in any typical labyrinth: 
    a sort of order that seems to be disorderly - or alternatively an apparent 
    order which in reality only serves to mask chaos. 
   </p> <p>A similar discovery 
    is made by Adam Appleby in the British Museum. In the quote cited in 
    section <b><i>3.2.1 </i></b>he finds out that what seemed to him "an 
    irritating maze" from the ground level becomes a beautiful "abstract 
    geometrical relief" when contemplated from the height of a gallery. 
    And Adam unexpectedly ends up on the gallery precisely because of the 
    labyrinthine character of parts of the British Museum. He is trying 
    to escape from a library employee, who he thinks is chasing him for 
    causing the fire-alarm, when he accidentally opens a door hidden in 
    the wall. What he sees is 
   </p>   
   <blockquote> 
    
    another country: 
    dark, musty, infernal. A maze of iron galleries, lined with books 
    and connected by tortuous iron staircases, webbed his confused 
    vision. He was in the stacks - he knew it - but it was difficult 
    to connect this cramped and gloomy warren with the civilized spaciousness 
    of the Reading Room. (<i>BM</i>: 90)
    
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    In this quote one can find 
    a few elements shared by the British Museum and the other two literary 
    libraries. Books are stored in <i>galleries</i> connected by <i>staircases</i> 
    - like in Borges. The general impression is sinister - like in both Eco 
    and Borges. And, like in Eco, there is a contrast between the civilized, 
    orderly Reading Room/scriptorium and the chaotic, mazelike library. 
   </p> <p>Adam spends some time 
    lost in the infernal labyrinth (this passage with its Catholic hell 
    imagery is a pastiche of Graham Greene's prose), but finally manages 
    to get out: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    He weaved his 
    way through a labyrinth of bookshelves, hoping to stumble upon 
    some way out. . . . At last he came upon a door from behind which 
    he thought he could hear the sounds of ordinary human life. He 
    slowly opened the door, and breathed a sigh of relief. He was 
    at the North Entrance. (<i>BM</i>: 94)
    
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    All the main elements of 
    a labyrinth are present or at least latent even in such a familiar library 
    as the British Museum Library. The design is a combination of order and 
    chaos, it has a menacing, awesome aspect and is difficult to get out of. 
    Adam is not especially keen to penetrate its secrets. He is not trying 
    to find a mysterious manuscript there, like William, nor is he expecting 
    to find revelatory meaning in its books, as the librarians of Babel do. 
    For him it is just one more episode of his episode-riddled day of work. 
    The library may be as much of a labyrinth as it likes, but Adam has to 
    go on with his overdue dissertation. 
   </p>
   <h4>3.3 
    FIRE</h4>

   <p>A traditional library, 
    storing tonnes of paper books, is obviously a perfect setting for a 
    spectacular fire. And indeed fire is in some form present in both <i>Il 
     nome della rosa</i> and <i>The British Museum is Falling Down</i>. It 
    does not appear in "La Biblioteca de Babel"; maybe because fire is not 
    really compatible with the kind of universe described there if the universe 
    is to last. Just like antimatter is not compatible with the real universe 
    if it is to last. 
   </p> <p>In the monastic library 
    from <i>The Name of the Rose</i> fire is present almost from the beginning. 
    William and Adso realize that something strange is happening up there 
    in the library as they are told that during the nights mysterious fatuous 
    fires can be seen flickering in the windows. It then turns out that 
    these are the special chemical oil-lamps already alluded to. Everybody 
    who wants to illegally penetrate the library has to do it at night, 
    when there is no natural light, and so he must bring fire with himself. 
    The library seems to be condemned practically from the beginning, when 
    we learn that there are quite a few individuals walking around with 
    burning oil lamps there. William says that to resolve the mystery of 
    the library they need two things: know the way to enter and to have 
    a light. And he authorizes Adso to steal a lamp from the kitchen (<i>NR</i>: 
    146). When William and Adso are on the point of entering the library 
    most secret place - finis Africae - where the forbidden books are kept, 
    Adso almost causes a fire: 
    
   </p>   
   <blockquote><p>
     
     posai rapidamente 
     la lampada sul tavolo al centro della stanza, compii il gesto 
     nervosamente, la fiamma andò a lambire la legatura di un 
     libro che vi era posato. 
    </p> <p>"Attento sciocco!" 
     gridò Guglielmo, e con un soffio spense la fiamma. "Vuoi 
     mettere a fuoco la biblioteca?" 
    </p> <p>(I quickly put 
     the lamp on the table at the centre of the room, I made the 
     gesture nervously, the lamp ended up licking the cover of a 
     book that was laying there. 
    </p> <p>"Look out, you 
     fool!" William shouted, and blew out the flame. "You want to 
     set fire to the library?')(<i>NR</i>: 462) 
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    This incident is the last 
    warning, to the characters and to the readers, before, some hours/pages 
    later the library bursts out in flames. This time it is the blind librarian 
    Jorge da Burgos who is guilty. Fighting with Adso and William over the 
    forbidden manuscript, he makes Adso's oil-lamp fall among a heap of books: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     
     L'olio si versò, 
     il fuoco si apprese subito a una pergamena fragilissima che divamp� 
     come un fascio di sterpi secchi. 
    </p> <p>(The oil poured 
     out, the fire soon caught on a very fragile parchment which 
     burst out like a bunch of dry firewood) (<i>NR</i>: 486) 
    </p></blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    
    The library, which has 
    coexisted for so long with the feeble oil-lamp fire, seems to want to 
    burn at last, to consume itself in a catastrophic climax. 
    
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>              Tutto avvenne 
     in pochi attimi, una vampata si levò dai volumi, come si 
     quelle pagine millenarie anelassero da secoli all'arsione e gioissero 
     nel soddisfare di colpo una immemoriale sete di ecpirosi. 
    </p> <p>(Everything 
     happened in one moment, a flame rose from the volumes, as if 
     those millenary pages craved for to burn for ages and as if 
     they rejoiced satisfying at once an immemorial thirst of combustion.) 
     (ibid.) 
    </p></blockquote>           
   
   <p>
    
    It is almost as if the 
    library and fire are two inseparable elements, as if the final conflagration 
    is really inevitable. The fatuous lights observed in the library windows 
    at the beginning of the story are now coupled by real, and even more frightening, 
    flames roaring in the whole Edifice: "Tutte le finestre erano ormai illuminate, 
    un fumo nero usciva dal tetto . . ." (all the windows were now illuminated, 
    a black smoke was coming from the roof . . .) (<i>NR</i>: 491). 
   </p> <p>The disaster is unstoppable 
    and total. The whole abbey is incinerated and the event is described 
    in apocalyptic terms. The monks rush about chaotically, some of them 
    trying to recuperate their "pergamene amatissime", beloved parchments 
    (<i>NR</i>: 491), others trying uselessly to extinguish the blazes. 
    Crazed animals get loose and escape from the inferno bellowing horribly 
    and trampling what or whoever gets in their way. The horses are transformed 
    into frightening ominous monsters: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     
     Alcune scintille 
     raggiunsero la criniera di molti cavalli e si vide la spianata 
     percorsa da creature infernali, da destrieri fiammegianti che 
     travolgevano tutto sul loro cammino che non aveva né meta 
     né requie. Vidi il vecchio Alinardo, che si aggirava smarrito 
     senza aver compreso cosa accadesse, travolto dal magnifico Brunello, 
     aureolato di fuoco, transportato nella polvere e ivi abbandonato, 
     povera cosa informe. Ma non ebbi né modo né tempo 
     di soccorrerlo, perché scene non dissimili avvenivano ormai 
     ogni dove. 
    </p> <p>(Some sparks 
     got into the manes of many horses, and one could see the infernal 
     creatures, the flaming steeds, running over everything on their 
     way, which had neither goal nor rest. I saw the old Alinard, 
     who wandered, lost, without having understood what was happening, 
     run over by the magnificent fire- aureoled Brunellus, dragged 
     in the dust and there left alone, poor formless thing.)(<i>NR</i>: 
     493) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   
   <p>
    People realize that the 
    dimensions of the catastrophe exceed human powers that the one thing left 
    to do is to flee "quella bieca parvenza di Armageddon" (this gloomy semblance 
    of Armageddon) (ibid.). 
   </p> <p>The fire lasted for 
    three days and three nights, and the biggest library of Christianity 
    was destroyed together with the abbey that was to protect it. All that 
    was left were the scorched fragments of parchment Adso will re-read 
    for the rest of his life. 
   </p> <p>As is maybe to be expected 
    in a parodic book like <i>The British Museum</i>, the fire menacing 
    the library there is by no means that serious. In fact it is a comic 
    event. The fire alarm is false: it is caused by a ridiculous telephone 
    misunderstanding. 
   </p> <p>Adam tries to make a 
    phone call but something goes wrong with the connections and he engages 
    in an absurd three-person conversation with the operator and another 
    caller who wants the police. The conversation ends with the following 
    exchange: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     'Look,'he said 
     to the operator, 'are you the one who put through a call just 
     now from Colorado for a man called Bernie?' 
    </p> <p>'Burning?' said 
     the operator. 'You don't want the police, you need the fire 
     service.' (<i>BM</i>: 85) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   
   <p>
    When Adam gets back to 
    the Museum, there is an unusual commotion there. The phone operator alarmed 
    the firemen and chaos rules in the Reading Room. The scenes are a comic 
    version of the apocalypse: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    Beyond the doorway, 
    similar disorder prevailed. Some readers stood on their desks, 
    and gazed about hopefully for rescue. Pushing his way through 
    the crowd, Adam nearly tripped over a prostrate nun, saying her 
    rosary. Near by, a Negro priest, hurriedly collecting his notes 
    on St Thomas Aquinas, was being urged to hear someone's confession. 
    A few courageous and stoical souls continued working calmly at 
    their books, dedicated scholars to the last. One of them betrayed 
    his inner tension by lighting a cigarette, evidently reasoning 
    that normal fire precautions were now redundant. He was immediately 
    drenched with chemical foam by an over-enthusiastic fireman. Shouts 
    and cries violated the hallowed air which had hitherto been disturbed 
    by nothing louder than the murmur of subdued conversation, or 
    the occasional thump of dropped books. The dome seemed to look 
    with disapproval at this anarchic spectacle. Already ugly sins 
    of looting were in evidence. Adam caught sight of a distinguished 
    historian furtively filling the pockets of his raincoat from the 
    open shelves. (<i>BM</i>: 89)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    The vocabulary used to 
    describe the alarm has definite religious, end-of-the-world overtones: 
    <i>prostrate nun, rosary, priest, confession, souls, ugly sins</i>. But 
    in the end the doomsday is a 'hoax', as says Adam's friend Camel. 
   </p> <p>Fire reappears in <i>The 
     British Museum is Falling Down</i> when a manuscript Adam finally manages 
    to lay his hand on gets burned together with Adam's scooter (see the 
    next section). This has a parallel in <i>Il nome</i>. The Aristotle 
    manuscript everybody has been trying to get at is burned in the final 
    conflagration. 
   </p>
   <h4>3.4. 
    MANUSCRIPTS</h4>
   <p>The manuscripts this 
    section is going to deal with are texts the protagonists look for. They 
    have been lost, or are inaccessible or even dangerous. They finally 
    find them, but only to lose them again. A sought-after object is a familiar 
    enough literary topos, but in the case of the two novels analyzed this 
    object is a text. Considering the importance of libraries for those 
    novels' plot, this fact seems to be a further indicator of their meta-textual 
    character. 
   </p> <p>In the Library of Babel, 
    it seems, almost everybody is looking for some book. (A printed book. 
    In that universe handwriting is only an imperfect imitation of print 
    and as such is of no importance or possible interest. See <i>F:</i> 
    91) The narrator confesses to have peregrinated in his youth looking 
    for a book, maybe the catalog of catalogs (<i>F:</i> 90). Others spend 
    their life looking for "Vindications" - texts that would justify the 
    life of every man of the universe (<i>F:</i> 94). Still others expect 
    to find a book that would explain all about the universe, that would 
    be "la cifra y el compendio perfecto <i>de todos los demás</i>" 
    (the cipher and the perfect compendium <i>of all the other books</i>) 
    (<i>F:</i> 97); or at least to find the man that has read it. As the 
    library contains every possible book, there is an indefinite number 
    of books it is worth devoting one's life to pursue... The Borges story 
    lacks, however, a central looked-for object, just as it lacks a central 
    protagonist. 
   </p> <p>In <i>Il nome della 
     rosa</i> there is one such book - a cause of most of the things that 
    happen in the abbey. The protagonists (and the readers) try to guess 
    what book it is for most of the novel's length. The clues accumulate: 
    a series of disputes about laughter with Jorge, then some notes about 
    the book made by a monk who began to read it, a bibliographical reference 
    in the catalog. From this catalog note William learns that the manuscript 
    in question is a "liber acephalus de stupris virginum et meretricum 
    amoribus" (headless book about virgins' disgraces and whores' romances) 
    (<i>NR</i>: 442). At this point, using his intertextual erudition, he 
    already begins to suspect that the manuscript is the lost second part 
    of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>. This second part deals with comedy and 
    complements the first part, which dealt with tragedy. Jorge thinks that 
    a book on comedy written by an <i>auctoritas</i> will legitimize laughter 
    and nothing will stop people from using it in order to subvert the existing 
    power relations. So he first hides the book in the most secret part 
    of the labyrinth (finis Africae) and when he realizes that in spite 
    of that some inquisitive monks have managed to get at it, he poisons 
    it. Anyone who begins to read it licks their index finger and uses it 
    to separate the sticky pages. In this way the poison gets into the victims 
    body and he soon dies. 
   </p> <p>When William and Adso 
    finally find their way to finis Africae, where Jorge hides with the 
    book, Jorge lets William read it, expecting him to get poisoned. However, 
    William has realized that the book is dangerous and uses gloves. Jorge 
    seeing his machinations frustrated decides to destroy the book, even 
    at the cost of his own life. He takes it from William and tries to escape, 
    eating its pages. When the pursuers get him, he causes a fire and throws 
    the book into the flames. 
   </p> <p>But what is lost is 
    rather Aristotle's authorship and authorization rather than the content 
    of the book itself. This content William manages to more or less reconstruct 
    reading other books - to the amazement of both Adso and Jorge (<i>NR</i>: 
    475). William is aware of the meta-literary nature of books, at least 
    some books. Adso asks surprised: 
    
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     "Come mai? Per 
     sapere cosa dice un libro ne dovete leggere altri?" 
    </p> <p>"Talora si pu� 
     fare cos�. Spesso i libri parlano di altri libri. . . 
     . Non potresti, leggendo Alberto, sapere cosa avrebbe potuto 
     dire Tomasso? O leggendo Tomasso sapere cosa avesse detto Averroè?" 
    </p> <p>("How come? 
     In order to know what a book says you should read other books?" 
    </p> <p>"Perhaps it 
     could be done. Often books talk about other books. . . . Couldn't 
     you, reading Albert, get to know what Thomas might have said? 
     Or reading Thomas get to know what Averroès had said?")(<i>NR</i>: 
     289) 
     
    </p></blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    Thus the protagonists look 
    for the lost manuscript simultaneously on two levels: they look for its 
    hiding place, trying to get at the physical manuscript, and at the same 
    time William tries to reconstruct its content from the content of other 
    books stored in the library. 
   </p> <p>Finally, as it has already 
    been observed in chapter <b>2</b>, the very novel <i>Il nome della rosa</i> 
    is supposed to be a translation of a lost book which in turn was a translation 
    etc. These numerous lost books, reconstructions, translations and versions 
    are reminiscent of the situation in the Library of Babel where no text 
    is irreplaceable and where any book is already present in other books 
    that are commentaries, versions or obscure translations of it. "[I] 
    libri parlano di libri, ovvero � come se parlassero fra loro." 
    (Books talk about books, or it is as if they talked between themselves.) 
    (<i>NR</i>: 289) And library as a figure embodies this incessant intertextual 
    dialog. 
   </p> <p>The manuscript Adam 
    Appleby is trying to get at in <i>The British Museum</i> is a much less 
    grandiose book than Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>. It is an unpublished 
    novel by Egbert Merrymarsh, "the Catholic belletrist, younger contemporary 
    of Chesterton and Belloc" (<i>BM</i>: 48). 
   </p> <p>Adam gets frustrated 
    with his unfinishable thesis on long sentences in modern fiction and 
    goes to see Mrs Rottingdean, Merrymarsh's "niece", who wrote him a letter 
    saying she was in possession of some unpublished papers by the writer. 
    He hopes that if these appear to be of interest he might be able to 
    write on them or publish them and so advance his academic career. The 
    papers she shows him prove worthless, but her seventeen year old daughter 
    Virginia tries to seduce Adam and as part of her strategy reveals to 
    him some interesting secrets. It turns out that Mrs Rottingdean is no 
    niece but Merrymarsh's former lover. It also turns out that Merrymarsh 
    described their affaire in a fictionalized novel form and that Virginia 
    once managed to save the manuscript of this text from fire when her 
    mother was trying to burn it together with other materials discrediting 
    Merrymarsh's reputation. Virginia still has the manuscript of the novel 
    and is disposed to give it to Adam if he agrees to have sex with her. 
    Adam who is a loving husband and a Catholic has serious qualms about 
    it, but he finally braces himself up to return to Virginia's house and 
    do whatever is necessary to "get his hands on Merrymarsh's scandalous 
    confessions" and with them he intends to 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    
    deal a swinging 
    blow at the literary establishment, at academe, at Catholicism, 
    at fate. He would publish his findings to the world, and leap 
    to fame or perdition in a blaze of notoriety. (<i>BM</i>: 129)
    
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Before she insists that 
    Adam keep his part of the deal, Virginia lets him read the manuscript. 
    The impression it makes on Adam is described in a passage already quoted 
    in section <b><i>2.3</i></b>. 
    The interrelation of fiction and reality that this fragment evokes has 
    also been commented on in that section. 
   </p> <p>Eventually, fortunately 
    or not, Adam does not have sex with Virginia but she lets him have the 
    book (see the next section for a discussion of the character of Virginia). 
    He put it in the tool compartment of his scooter and rides home. He 
    has an accident on the way � the engine bursts into flame and Adam does 
    not manage to salvage the Merrymarsh novel. "Egbert Merrymarsh's lost 
    masterpiece had perished in its second ordeal by fire." (<i>BM</i>: 
    149) Thus Adam's hopes to build his literary career on the publishing 
    of scandalous confessions by a Catholic writer are frustrated. 
   </p> <p>There are some similarities 
    between the lost manuscripts in Lodge and in Eco. Both are considered 
    dangerous by their custodians: because of subversive or revelatory content. 
    The Aristotle manuscript is kept hidden and the Merrymarsh closely escapes 
    burning. The protagonists try to get them, they succeed and for a short 
    time enjoy their possession but finally lose them again: both manuscripts 
    are destroyed by fire. Thus, it may be speculated, the presence of an 
    <i>author</i>itative text that might be used to stabilize signification 
    is denied to the protagonists (and to the readers). The manuscripts 
    only survive in versions, in palimpsests. In search of meaning the protagonists 
    and the readers are referred continually to other texts. Adam, it is 
    suggested, may get a part time job "scouting for books and manuscripts" 
    (<i>BM</i>: 152) for an American library. Adso will also be a reader 
    for the rest of his life, reading remains of the burned library. Both 
    of them will also write further palimpsest versions of life and fiction. 
   </p>
   <h4>3.5. 
    YOUNG GIRLS, SEX AND GENDER</h4>
   <p>In the three texts under 
    examination here, females, I will argue, are deleted from the library. 
    If they are accorded some role in these texts, it is a role outside 
    the library. Its employees and users are all, or almost all, male. (By 
    the way, this situation seems to contradict our experience of the real 
    world where my impression is the majority of librarians are women.) 
    <i>In Il nome della rosa</i> and <i>The British Museum is Falling Down</i> 
    the protagonists Adso and Adam have each a sexual adventure with a young 
    girl who is an outsider with respect to the world of texts and scholarly 
    pursuits. 
   </p> <p>The story by Borges 
    does not mention women at all. Apparently this universe is a male-only, 
    single-sex world. The word <i>bibliotecario</i> - (male) librarian - 
    appears four times. <i>Bibliotecarios</i> - librarians - two times. 
    <i>Hombre</i> - man - can be found on four occasions, and <i>hombres</i> 
    - men - on as many as ten occasions. However, there are no instances 
    of <i>bibliotecaria</i> or <i>mujer</i>, which would indicate the presence 
    of female inhabitants in the universe. How such a world is possible 
    is not explicit in the story. Indeed there are some facts that might 
    suggest that this universe is a contradiction. For example the librarians 
    are born, grow up and die. The narrator speaks of leaving "el dulce 
    haxgono natal" (sweet native hexagon) (<i>F:</i> 95) so they 
    are born at some point in time and space. He also talks of what he used 
    to see in his childhood (<i>F:</i> 96), that he travelled in his youth 
    (<i>F:</i> 90), and that now he is an old man (<i>F:</i> 99). He also 
    speaks about "jóvenes" (<i>F:</i> 99) and "hombres viejos" (<i>F: 
    </i>96) i.e. the young and the old. Thus the librarians grow old, like 
    human beings from the real world. At the beginning the narrator confesses 
    that he is preparing himself to die: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     ahora que mis 
     ojos casi no pueden descifrar lo que escribo, me preparo a morir 
     a unas pocas leguas del hexágono en que nací. Muerto, 
     no faltaran manos piadosas que me tiren por la baranda . . . 
    </p> <p>(now that my 
     eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die 
     just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once 
     I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me 
     over the railing . . .) (<i>F:</i> 90)

   <p>
    
    
    The narrator also mentions 
    a book seen by his father (<i>F:</i> 92). As is to be expected he never 
    mentions his mother. This absence of women is rather unexplainable in 
    terms of what we know about the world: generations of librarians succeed 
    themselves, baby-librarians are born but there are no mother-librarians 
    to bear them. Even if they do exist and are simply left unmentioned (which 
    would be curious enough) there are still some technical problems left: 
    there is space provided in the library to "sleep standing up" and to "satisfy 
    one's fecal necessities", but there is nowhere to give birth or to have 
    a sexual intercourse for that matter. Incidentally, although defecation 
    is provided for, no mention is made of eating or food (apart from the 
    lamps being called "frutas esféricas" - spherical fruits - <i>F:</i> 
    90). Indeed it is a strange and dismal world where you can die and defecate 
    but not eat or procreate. McGrady (1987: 805) makes a tentative suggestion 
    that the absence of the topic of love from Borges's fiction may be a way 
    of insinuating its importance; an application of the receipt from "El 
    jardín de los senderos que se bifurcan", where a character says: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     Omitir <i>siempre</i> 
     una palabra, recurrir a metáforas ineptas y perífrasis 
     evidentes, es quizá el modo más enfático 
     de indicarla. 
    </p> <p>(To <i>always</i> 
     omit a word, to recur to inept metaphors and evident periphrases, 
     is perhaps the most emphatic way of indicating it) (<i>F:</i> 
     114) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   <p>
    
    Following this interpretation 
    one would say that the female sex is deleted from "The library of Babel" 
    precisely in order to highlight its importance. How convincing such a 
    hypothesis is would be a matter of discussion. In the following paragraphs 
    we will see how the tendency to exclude the woman from the library and 
    to treat her as if she were somehow incompatible with scholarship and 
    textuality is more general in library fiction. 
   </p> <p>In the Benedictine monastery 
    in "Il nome della rosa" there are no women, understandably enough. It 
    turns up, however, that this absence is not absolute. One of the monks, 
    Remigio, makes women from the village come to the abbey at night and 
    has sex with them in exchange for food. One such night Adso surprises 
    him with a nameless peasant girl. The monk flees and Adso is left alone 
    with the frightened young girl. He tries to comfort her, she is impressed 
    by his youth and attractiveness, and they end up fornicating. When Adso 
    wakes up she is no longer there: he has not even learned her name (McGrady 
    (1987: 805) believes that it is <i>Rosa</i> as in the title of the novel). 
    Later on, when the inquisition comes to the abbey to investigate the 
    murders, she is accused of witchcraft and taken away to be executed. 
    Adso will never meet her again but will love her for a long time. 
   </p> <p>What is interesting 
    is the way Adso describes the girl, their encounter and his feelings 
    about her. On first intuiting her presence in the dark kitchen, he speaks 
    of "un qualcosa", a something, and goes on to describe her as more of 
    a strange, only half-human being rather than a real person. 
   </p>         
   <blockquote><p>    
     
     Rimasi io, sul 
     limine tra refettorio e cucina, e un qualcosa di impreciso presso 
     al forno. Qualcosa di impreciso - come dire? - mugolante. Proveniva 
     infatti dall'ombra un gemito, quasi un pianto sommesso, un singhiozzo 
     ritmico, di paura. 
    </p> <p>(Only the two 
     of us remained: I, between the refectory and the kitchen, and 
     this something vague - how should I say? - whimpering. In fact, 
     from the shadow a groan was coming, almost a subdued weeping, 
     a rhythmical frightened sobbing.) (<i>NR</i>: 245) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   <p>
    
    He later on recognizes 
    her as a frightened, crying young woman but nevertheless keeps on treating 
    her and speaking about her in this same vein. He estimates her age as 
    between seventeen and twenty but says about her "la creatura si calmò 
    e mi si avvicinò" (the creature calmed down, and came closer to 
    me) (<i>NR</i>: 247). In Italian the word "creatura" has the connotations 
    of something small and young and vulnerable rather than of something alien 
    and ridiculous or scary as is the case with the English "creature". So 
    an almost adult woman is talked about like a small child. Throughout the 
    text she is then referred to as "la fanciulla" - the little girl, the 
    lassie. As Adso says the girl "tremava come un uccellino d'inverno" (trembled 
    like a little bird in winter) (ibid.), a little later she "emise un gemito 
    sommesso di capra intenerita" (emitted a subdued groan of a goat when 
    moved by something). For him she is a part of nature and he uses nature 
    vocabulary to describe the beauty of various parts of her body: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     [I] suoi seni 
     mi apparvero come due cerbiatti, due gemelli di gazzelle che pascolavano 
     tra i gigli, il suo ombelico fu una coppa rotonda che non manca 
     mai di vino drogato, il suo ventre un mucchio di grano contornato 
     di fiori delle valli. 
    </p> <p>(Her breasts 
     looked to me like gazelle's twins that pasture among lilies, 
     her navel was a rounded cup that never lacks fragrant wine, 
     her belly a heap of wheat surrounded by the flowers of the valley. 
     (<i>NR</i>: 249) 
    </p></blockquote>
   
   <p>
    
    Of course this language 
    is not Adso's invention. He appropriates the vocabulary that the biblical 
    authors use to describe a woman's body, which is probably the only pertinent 
    way of description known to him. He is no exception in treating women 
    as part of nature rather than culture. And he may be justified in this 
    attitude: he is quite unfamiliar with females and no wonder they seem 
    to him some strange and beautiful creatures to be domesticated with familiar 
    vocabulary. This drive to associate the girl and nature recurs in many 
    places of the text. After she disappears for ever he often sees her in 
    the sounds and forms of the various animals and plants (<i>NR</i>: 281, 
    286). He compares "i gesti semplici i naturali con cui la fanciulla aveva 
    suscitato la mia passione e il mio desiderio" (the simple and natural 
    gestures with which the lass had excited my passion and my desire ) to 
    other cases of seduction where artful strategies are used (<i>NR</i>: 
    476). Even though she has the use of language, for the monks and for the 
    inquisitors interrogating her she is like a mute - she does not speak 
    Latin and they do not understand her vulgar language (<i>NR</i>: 334). 
    Nature language is used to extol her beauty and it is also used to deny 
    this beauty any value. Ubertino, an old Franciscan, tries to provoke repugnance 
    in Adso towards the supposed witch describing her as a sack of mucus, 
    blood, humors and bile. 
   </p> <p>Thus whether praised 
    for her beauty or depreciated for her physiology the woman is considered 
    no more than a body, a part of nature. In the library women only appear 
    as illuminations on the pages of manuscripts. They are represented by 
    two stereotypical extremes: the Whore of Babylon and the Virgin Mary. 
    For Adso looking at the pictures these two representations become momentarily 
    one and the same: 
   </p>
   <blockquote><p>
     
     questa era vascello 
     di ogni vizio, quella ricettacolo di ogni virtù. Ma le 
     fattezze erano muliebri in entrambi i casi, e a un certo punto 
     non fui più capace di capire cosa le distinguesse. 
    </p> <p>(this one was 
     a vessel of every vice, that one a rceptacle of every virtue. 
     But the features were womanly in both cases, and at some point 
     I was no longer able to understand what distinguished them.) 
     (<i>NR</i>: 244) 
     
    </p></blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Adso may be intuiting in 
    that moment that although these two stereotypical images are the only 
    source of knowledge about the other sex he has had access to, they may 
    in fact be false. This intuition is later confirmed when he has his sexual 
    adventure with the peasant girl, who sells her body to dirty monks but 
    offers it disinterestedly to Adso and this experience, although a sin, 
    seems to him the most beautiful thing on earth. 
   </p> <p>The role and perception 
    of women in <i>The name of the Rose</i> seems to be what it routinely 
    was in the middle ages. They are perceived as belonging to nature much 
    more than men. Usually they do not participate actively in the production 
    and reception of an important part of culture: written texts. They are 
    banned from the library. They only make an appearance there as the improbable 
    stereotypical icons of the Virgin and the Whore. 
   </p> <p>In <i>The British Museum</i> 
    sex is also a major preoccupation - especially sex as sexual activity. 
    Textuality and sexuality run parallel throughout this novel as they 
    do in many others by David Lodge (Ommundsen 1990: 124-125, 135-137). 
    In one later novel �<i>Small World</i> �the former becomes a metaphor 
    for the latter: one character even develops a theory of text as striptease 
    (ibid.). In <i>The British Museum </i>sex and texts are mostly in contrast, 
    and with a comic effect. 
   </p> <p>The way women are perceived 
    is less stereotyped in this novel than in Eco but some of the same familiar 
    patterns are discernible. The exclusion of women from the library also 
    operates. See in section <b>2.3</b> how surprised Adam is when he thinks 
    he sees his wife in the British Museum. There <i>are</i> some women 
    reading in the Museum Reading Room but they are perceived in a strikingly 
    different way to those who stay outside. Approaching the Museum on the 
    winter morning when there are no tourists, Adam regrets 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    the departure 
    of the pretty girls who sat on the steps in summer, eating sandwiches 
    and writing postcards, their carelessly disposed legs providing 
    an alluring spectacle for men approaching on ground level. (<i>BM</i>: 
    34)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Those pretty girls are 
    who just sit on the steps of the Museum are very different from the women 
    who work inside. The latter only appear once, in a list of the Museum 
    "familiar figures". They include: "the lady in shorts", "the woman who 
    sniffed", and most tellingly "pimply, bespectacled women smiling cruelly 
    to themselves as they noted an error in someone's footnote" (<i>BM</i>: 
    45). 
   </p> <p>There is a clear divide 
    here between young, nice, sexually attractive women who are outside 
    the threshold of the library and those almost unsexed, ugly and cruel 
    creatures from within. One is tempted to infer that what the pretty 
    girls on the steps do is congruous with their sex: they sit, they eat, 
    they are being attractive, and all the contact they have with textuality 
    is postcards. As a reward their retain their sexual identity. The women 
    inside are meant to be perverse. They have intruded into an area reserved 
    for men. They have entered the library, they deal with texts and try 
    to outdo male scholars at their own game, finding errors in their footnotes. 
    So accordingly they are described as cruel, unattractive and asexual, 
    they are made to look ridiculous and out of place. 
   </p> <p>The only two important 
    female characters are to be looked for outside the library. One is Barbara, 
    Adam's wife. Most of the novel is narrated from Adam's perspective abundantly 
    using indirect reported speech to report his words, thoughts and perceptions. 
    But the final chapter changes the point of view and transcribes Barbara's 
    stream of consciousness, on the Molly Bloom model. This is an important 
    concession to female perspective. The roles, however, that Adam and 
    Barbara perform in their marriage are very much the traditional ones. 
    She has no paid job and stays all day at home doing housework. Adam 
    leaves in the morning to work at the Museum and comes back in the evening. 
    Their sex life is a disaster: being practicing Catholics they are not 
    allowed to use reliable contraception. As a result of recurring to "natural" 
    methods they already have three children and live in a constant anxiety 
    that a fourth one may be on the way. Also they can only have sex on 
    a small number of days at specific moments in a month. This causes frustration 
    in both of them, and an incipient sex obsession in Adam. As quoted in 
    section <b><i>2.3.</i> </b>on he even defines fiction and life in terms 
    of having sex or having children. 
   </p> <p>While in search of the 
    Merrymarsh papers he meets the other important female character, Virginia. 
    In the final chapters Adam goes back and forth between her house and 
    the Museum in search of a textual and sexual discovery. The two opposed 
    worlds of text and sex seem to merge eventually in the person of Virginia 
    and in the sexually explicit manuscript she has to offer. She even has 
    to Adam a somewhat textual look. On her first appearance "she had a 
    white face and black hair and her dress was black" (<i>BM</i>: 100). 
    She is black-and-white just like a printed page. This does not make 
    her unattractive, however. When he meets her a little later he has a 
    chance to have a closer look at her. 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    
    The girl leaned 
    against the door and appraised him with a slow, sensual smile. 
    She looked pretty in pale, neglected kind of way, and her figure, 
    eloquently revealed by a black vee-neck sweater and tight skirt, 
    was agreeably contoured. (<i>BM</i>: 110)
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    Here the focus is on the 
    body and its attractiveness - which must be what Adam is focussing on, 
    being sexually frustrated as he is. They begin a conversation. Virginia's 
    mother, who brought her up in a very strict way and almost does not let 
    her out of house, is away and Virginia uses the opportunity to flirt with 
    Adam: 
   </p>
   <blockquote>
     
     '. . . What's 
     your name?' 
    <br />'Adam' 
    <br />'D'you think 
     I have nice breasts, Adam?' 
    <br />'Yes,' he said 
     truthfully. 
    <br />'You can touch 
     them if you like.' She patted the sofa invitingly. 
    </blockquote>
   <p>
    
    
    Adam, with difficulty, 
    resists, but when the girl promises to show him the sexually explicit 
    Merrymarsh manuscript he decides to come later. When he does come and 
    get the papers, Virginia expects him to fulfil his part of the deal. Adam 
    procrastinates inventing various excuses and finally Virginia, impatient, 
    throws him on the sofa and tries to get him undressed (which she already 
    is). They scuffle over undoing his belt and Virginia manages to pull down 
    his trousers only to reveal Barbara's lace pants Adam put on that morning 
    unable to find any clean pair of his own. This cools down the girl's enthusiasm. 
    Adam makes use of the accident to convince her that he is "funny that 
    way". "'Religion has played havoc with my married life'" (<i>BM</i>: 144) 
    he explains. The girl confesses: "'And I did so want to be the first sixth 
    former in St Monica to do it'" (<i>BM</i>: 145). And so it turns out that 
    Virginia is a virgin. In her, like in Adso's lover from <i>The Name of 
     the Rose</i>, two female stereotypes are collapsed: the sexually insatiable 
    and the sexually innocent. She is also reminiscent of other typical female 
    figures. She is a "raven-haired, honey-tongued" maiden held prisoner in 
    "Castle Perilous" by her mother, a "mad, key-rattling old queen" (<i>BM</i>: 
    129). She also is a dangerous seductress type, a woman leading men to 
    sin, a teenage Eve and a little grown-up Lolita. 
   </p> <p>In Eco and in Lodge 
    the young protagonists Adso and Adam have a problem in common: their 
    sex life. Adso is a monk and as such can have no sex life legally. His 
    sexual drive finds an outlet in dreams, visions and compulsive thoughts. 
    Adam being a Catholic can have no safe sex. He is sex obsessed much 
    like Adso. The two characters meet suddenly a young attractive woman 
    willing to have sexual relations with them and are much perplexed by 
    this fact. In Eco the intercourse takes place, but then the girl is 
    taken away to be executed and Adso goes back to his celibate condition. 
    In Lodge the sexual act is not consummated and Adam retreats down a 
    fire escape to go back to his frustrated marital life. 
   </p> <p>The two novels also 
    share some elements in the treatment given to women. Women are to varying 
    degrees represented as opposed to scholarship and as out of place in 
    the library. the novels focus on their bodies and their physiological 
    functions. They are either beautiful and attractive or ugly and disgusting. 
    They copulate, menstruate and give birth. (Barbara's pregnancies and 
    her overdue period is a major source of Adam's preoccupation during 
    the day. For Adso, the sexual act he engaged in provokes a number of 
    reflections on the nature of womanhood and on love.) Those who work 
    in the library dealing with texts are male. Thus two opposing worlds 
    are constructed: the library, the male-dominated realm of textuality, 
    and the outside-the-library world of female bodiliness. There is a constant 
    tension between these two domains.
