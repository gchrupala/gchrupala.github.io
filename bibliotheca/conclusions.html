<h3>4. CONCLUSIONS: THE LIBRARY AND INTERTEXTUALITY</h3>
    
        <h4>4.1. 
          GENERAL REMARKS</h4>

<p>        In this final 
          chapter we will try to arrive at some sort of synthesis of the threads 
          of argumentation running through the preceding sections. The theme of 
          library as an embodiment of intertextuality will be once more picked 
          up. The analysis of common motives carried out in the preceding chapters 
          will be used in order to show that the three texts, "La Biblioteca de 
          Babel", <i>The British Museum</i> and <i>Il nome della rosa</i>, can 
          be interpreted as having a similar vision of the nature of fictions 
          and their relation to reality and to other texts. This vision is pretty 
          much the same as the one espoused by intertextually-oriented theories 
          of literature, sketched in <a href="chapter1.html">chapter 
          1</a>.</p>
         
         
   
         
   <h4>4.2. 
          VOICES IN THE LIBRARY</h4>
<p>
        It is no accident 
          that one of the first intertextually conscious texts, <i>Don Quijote</i>, 
          features an important episode at the beginning when the contents of 
          Quijote's library are scrutinized. The priest and the barber examine 
          the books of chivalry that became an alternative reality for the protagonist 
          and condemn most of them to fire (Cervantes 1995: 59-64). In a novel 
          dealing mainly with other books a library is a quite natural setting.</p>
   <p>     The textual 
          libraries we have been looking at are full of voices. The texts dialog 
          between themselves, comment on each other and quote each other. The 
          voices are multiple and multilingual. In "The Library of Babel" the 
          books use every conceivable language and are for the most part babelically 
          unintelligible. A epitomic book is written in "un dialecto samoyedo-lituano 
          del guaraní, con inflexiones de árabe clásico" (a Samoyedic Lithuanian 
          dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections) (<i>F:</i> 93). 
          The intertextual dialog in Library-Universe is rather futile. This library 
          already contains every possible permutation of the letters of alphabet. 
          It is a static universe: all discourse is just the repetition of what 
          is already written somewhere. New texts cannot come to being out of 
          the intercourse of other texts because new texts are an impossibility; 
          they are just clones of already existing books. "La Biblioteca de Babel" 
          is a library dystopia and it is a universe dystopia.</p>
<p>        In <i>Il nome 
          della rosa</i> the vision is less pessimistic. The library is, at least 
          potentially, a more dynamic, evolving structure. Jorge da Burgos, who 
          seems to share the static vision of knowledge inferable from Borges, 
          tries to convert the library into a guardian of secrets. His idea is 
          that all the books are to be simply stored and the orthodox ones reproduced. 
          He knows that creative intertextual exchange of ideas and elaboration 
          of venerable topics dealt with by the auctoritas pose a danger for the 
          existing power relationships. He does all he can to prevent the library 
          from abolishing the status quo - and this very effort of his is an implicit 
          acknowledgement of the creative potential of the library and of intertextuality. 
          Adso also perceives this potential. The multilingual and multicultural 
          diversity of the library is fascinating - but also disconcerting (Gritti 
          1991: 105). When William explains to him his idea that books refer to 
          other books as much as they refer to extratextual reality (see <a href="chapter3.html">section 
          3.4.</a>) it scares 
          him a little because it seems to do away with the importance of the 
          human subject. The library seems to use the scholars for its own ends.</p>

               <p>
                La 
                  biblioteca mi parve ancora più inquietante. Era dunque il luogo 
                  di un lungo e secolare susurro, di un dialogo impercettibile 
                  tra pergamena e pergamena, una cosa viva, un ricettacolo di 
                  potenze non dominabili da una mente umana, tesoro dei segreti 
                  emanati da tante menti, e sopravissuti alla morte di coloro 
                  che li avevano prodotti, o se ne erano fatti tramite. </p>
     <p>
                (The 
                  library seemed to me even more disturbing. It was, then, the 
                  place of a long and ancient whisper, of an imperceptible dialog 
                  between a parchment and a parchment, a living thing, a receptacle 
                  of powers impossible to master for a human mind, a treasury 
                  of the secrets emanated by so many minds, which have survived 
                  the death of those who had produced them, or who were their 
                  medium) (<i>NR</i>: 289)</p>
        </blockquote>      
            
          <p>
        
        This passage 
          is a perfect illustration of what are the implications of the intertextual 
          focus on literature and on culture in general. The texts become as if 
          independent of human beings who produce them - people are only instruments 
          in the process of discourse constructing itself. Libraries are then 
          places of discourse gestation, they seem to be living things feeding 
          on human minds. </p>
    <p>        As evident 
          from the quotes in <a href="chapter2.html">section 
          2.5.</a><b> </b>Adam 
          Appleby would quite willingly become food for the library. He craves 
          to be automated, he wants his thesis to write itself. So far his dissertation 
          has only succeeded in producing a large collection of file cards but 
          has failed to arrange itself in the correct order. So far it has remained 
          a virtual thesis rather that a fully developed tentacle of self-propagating 
          discourse. </p>
<p>       
  <i>The British 
          Museum</i> speaks with others' voices just like <i>Il nome della rosa</i> 
          does. They are mostly the voices of modernist texts mentioned in the 
          <a href="index.html"><b>introduction</b></a>, 
          but also other unacknowledged ones such as Borges. The novel mocks some 
          of them and emulates others, striving to appropriate all. Intertextuality 
          is operative here as much as in any other: books talk about other books 
          and they also talk between themselves. But in <i>The British Museum</i> 
          the implications of the intertextual theory that result in the obliteration 
          of the human subject are put to a comic use. Adam's thesis does not 
          propagate itself just as it should, and the rather awesome archetypal 
          library from Borges and Eco here is a source of much comic imagery. 
          One such scene is the apocalyptic scene in the fire-menaced library 
          (see <a href="chapter3.html">section 
          3.3.</a>), which seems 
          to be a mocking anticipation of the fire episode in Eco. A comic twist 
          is also given to what goes on in the North Library. It is a kind of 
          inner sanctuary, parallel to finis Africae, where especially valuable 
          or dangerous (i.e. pornographic) books are kept. Adam and his friend 
          Camel are not really keen on this place.</p>
         
           
   <blockquote>          
               
                They 
                  did not usually work there: it was overheated, and its low rectangular 
                  shape and green furnishings gave one the sense of being in an 
                  aquarium for tropical fish. The North Library was used especially 
                  for consulting rare and valuable books, and there were also 
                  a number of seats reserved for the exclusive use of eminent 
                  scholars, who enjoyed the privilege of leaving their books on 
                  their desks for indefinite periods. These desks were rarely 
                  occupied except by piles of books and cards bearing distinguished 
                  names, and they reminded Adam of a waxworks from which all the 
                  exhibits had been withdrawn for renovation. (<i>BM</i>: 46)
              </blockquote>
            <p>
          
        
        In this travesty 
          of finis Africae the intertextual dialog that is supposed to fill libraries 
          seems to be a bit constipated. Like in the intertextual literary theory 
          scholars - the writing subjects - are obliterated. They are waxwork 
          exhibits in renovation. And their role is taken up by card-bearing piles 
          of books. In Eco the library worries Adso; it seems alive and uncontrollable 
          to him. In the above passage from Lodge the impression is of ridicule 
          and deadness.</p>
    <p>
        The philosopher 
          Daniel Dennett confesses his mixed feelings when, even before they appeared 
          in print form, he found that his ideas on "The Self as the Centre of 
          Narrative Gravity" have already been parodied in a David Lodge novel 
          <i>Nice Work</i> (Dennett 1991: 410-411). In some respects <i>The British 
          Museum is Falling Down</i>, apart from echoing anterior texts � the 
          literary tradition - is a parody of many motives that fifteen years 
          later appear in <i>Il nome della rosa</i>. In the "Naturalmente, un 
          manuscritto" chapter we read that "si danno altresì visioni di libri 
          non ancora scritti" (visions happen of books not yet written) (<i>NR</i>: 
          13). Apparently, there also happen parodies of books not yet written. 
          And this fact might be interpreted as an ironic confirmation of the 
          radical implications of intertextuality: there is no author carefully 
          selecting a source text and equally carefully parodying or otherwise 
          transforming it. There are fragments of discourse freely circulating 
          between brains and between books. They enter multiple dialogs, are transformed 
          and crossed-over, to reemerge in future generations of texts.</p>
    <p>       
     If we adopt 
          this point of view, then we can try to extracts some such discourse 
          fragments from the three texts dealt with in the preceding chapters. 
          Some of them would correspond to the common motives isolated in <a href="chapter3.html">chapter 
          3</a>. The library, 
          the labyrinth, fire, the manuscript, the girl � these are elements that 
          tend to appear and reappear with one another. They may have developed 
          a sort of co-adaptation to reproduce together in the environment of 
          literary text. </p>
    <p>In spite of 
          the recurrence of these motives in the three texts, and in spite of 
          their connections with the important common theme of intertextuality, 
          "La Biblioteca" <i>Il nome </i>and <i>The Museum</i> are all rather 
          different as to how they see and present the operation of intertextuality. 
          In Borges it is an infinite, overwhelming and bleak nightmare. In Eco 
          it is a fascinating and disturbing process going on inside the mysterious 
          labyrinth of the library and the equally mysterious labyrinth of the 
          world. In Lodge it seems to be something inevitable and at the same 
          time inevitably comic. The library stands for many things, and one of 
          the things it stands for - intertextuality - is an ambiguous phenomenon. 
          But in all cases the confines of the library are a perfectly suited 
          terrain to explore the intricacies of fiction, reality and textuality.</p>
                
       <h4>4.3. 
          FURTHER RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>
        The present 
          study has some obvious limitations. The most important one is its restricted 
          scope. While it was necessary to limit the range of texts dealt with 
          in order to be able to study them in reasonable detail, few generalizations 
          are feasible on the basis of three texts only. Also the presentation 
          of the theoretical framework has been limited to the minimum in order 
          to provide space for the actual analysis of texts. It follows that in 
          order to substantiate the paper's claims, or alternatively to disprove 
          them, a more inclusive study would be necessary. </p>
       <p> In the process 
          of preparing the present thesis another interesting area of research 
          emerged. It turned out that there are striking similarities between 
          the way in which intertextual process is described by literary theorist 
          and the way information transmission and cultural evolution is talked 
          about by cognitive scientist, evolutionists or philosophers with a scientific 
          bent. Both groups also happen to use the library metaphor to illustrate 
          their ideas: compare Adso's description of the library as a living thing 
          making use of human minds (in the preceding section) with Dennett's 
          words: "A scholar is just a library's way of making another library" 
          (1991: 202). He uses this phrase as a slogan illustrating that memes 
          (units of cultural transmission, analogous to genes in genetic transmission) 
          evolve independently of their hosts. This is reminiscent of the assertions 
          about the obliteration of the writing subject made by Kristeva or Barthes. 
          These correspondences may prove a promising area of study. In fact some 
          of these common ideas have already been traced by meme researchers (see 
          Gatherer 1997) but the complementary interest seems to be lacking in 
          literary theorists - in spite of the cross-fertilizing <i>dialog</i> 
          that such an interest might initiate.</p>
