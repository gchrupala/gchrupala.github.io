     THE universe (which others call the Library) is composed 
     of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, 
     with vast air shafts in the middle, surrounded by very low railings. 
     From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower 
     floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, 
     five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two: their height, 
     which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of 
     a normal librarian. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway 
     which opens on to another gallery, identical to the first and to all 
     the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small 
     closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy 
     one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, 
     which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the</p> <p>
     [89]</p> <p>
     hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates 
     appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is 
     not infinite (if it really were, why this illusory duplication?), I 
     prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the 
     infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruits which bear the 
     name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. 
     The light they emit is insufficient, incessant. </p> <p>
     Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my 
     youth: I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of 
     catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am 
     preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was 
     born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw 
     me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will 
     sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, 
     which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists 
     argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space 
     or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular 
     or pentagonal room is inconceivable (The mystics claim that their ecstasy 
     reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, 
     whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the 
     walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical 
     book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: 
     <i>The Library is a sphere whose exact centre is any one of its hexagons 
      and whose circumference is inaccessible.</i></p> <p>
     [90] </p> <p>
     There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; 
     each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is 
     of four hundred and ten pages: each page, of forty lines, each line, 
     of some eighty letters which are black in colour. There are also letters 
     on the spine of each book: these letters do not indicate or prefigure 
     what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed 
     mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite 
     of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I 
     wish to recall a few axioms. </p> <p>
     First: The Library exists <i>ab aeterno.</i> This truth, 
     whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot 
     be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, 
     may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi: the universe, 
     with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible 
     stairways for the traveler and of a latrine for the seated librarian, 
     can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the 
     divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols 
     which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic 
     letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical. 
    </p> <p>
     Second: <i>The orthographical symbols are twenty-five 
      in number.(1) </i>This finding made it possible, three hundred years 
     ago,</p> <p>
     [91]</p> <p>
     to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve 
     satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless 
     and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw 
     in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters 
     MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very 
     much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the 
     next-to-last page says <i>Oh time thy pyramids. </i>This much is already 
     known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are 
     leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I 
     know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious 
     custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding 
     a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm.... They admit 
     that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural 
     symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the 
     books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not 
     entirely fallacious.) </p> <p>
     For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable 
     books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the 
     most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different 
     from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right 
     the tongue is dialectal and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.</p> <p>
     [92]</p> <p>
     All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten 
     pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter 
     how dialectal or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter 
     could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third 
     line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another 
     position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others 
     thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, 
     though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators. 
    </p> <p>
     Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 
     (2) came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly 
     two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder 
     who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they 
     were Yiddish. Within a century the language was established: a Samoyedic 
     Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The 
     content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated 
     with examples of variation with unlimited repetition. These examples 
     made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental 
     law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter 
     how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, 
     the period, the comma, the </p> <p>
     [93]</p> <p>
     twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged 
     a fact which travellers have confirmed: <i>In the vast library there 
      are no two identical books. </i>From these two incontrovertible premises 
     he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all 
     the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a 
     number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): in other words, 
     all that it is given to express, in ail languages. Everything: the minutely 
     detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the 
     faithful catalogue of the Library, thousands and thousands of false 
     catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the 
     demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel 
     of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary 
     on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every 
     book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books. 
    </p> <p>
     When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all 
     books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men 
     felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. 
     There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not 
     exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly 
     usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal 
     was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which 
     vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained 
     prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned 
    </p> <p>
     [94]</p> <p>
     their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, 
     urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims 
     disputed in the narrow corridors, proffered dark curses, strangled each 
     other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air 
     shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants 
     of remote regions. Others went mad ... The Vindications exist (I have 
     seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who perhaps 
     are not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility 
     of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, 
     can be computed as zero. </p> <p>
     At that time it was also hoped that a clarification 
     of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time 
     - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could 
     be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, 
     the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language 
     required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now 
     men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers, <i>inquisitors.</i> 
     I<i> </i>have seen them in the performance of their function: they always 
     arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway 
     which almost killed them: they talk with the librarian of galleries 
     and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through 
     it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover 
     anything. </p> <p>
     As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by 
     an excessive depression. The certitude </p> <p>
     [95]</p> <p>
     that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books 
     and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. 
     A blasphemous sect suggested that the searchers should cease and that 
     all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by 
     an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities 
     were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared but in my 
     childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide 
     in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly 
     mimic the divine disorder. </p> <p>
     Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental 
     to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials 
     which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure 
     and condemned whole shelves: the hygienic, ascetic furor caused the 
     senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but 
     those who deplore the 'treasures' destroyed by this frenzy neglect two 
     notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of 
     human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique irreplaceable, 
     but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand 
     imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. 
     Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences 
     of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these 
     fanatics produced. They were urged on by </p> <p>
     [96]</p> <p>
     the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson 
     Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated 
     and magical. </p> <p>
     We also know of another superstition of that time: 
     that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) 
     there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium 
     of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous 
     to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's 
     cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they 
     exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated 
     and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method- 
     To locate book A, consult first a book B which indicates A's position; 
     to locate book B, consult first a book C., and so on to infinity.... 
     In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. 
     It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf 
     of the universe (3); I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, 
     even though it were thousands of years ago - may have examined and read 
     it. If honour and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for 
     others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me </p> <p>
     [97]</p> <p>
     be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in 
     one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain 
     that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and 
     even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They 
     speak (I know) of 'the feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly 
     in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything 
     like a delirious divinity'. These words, which not only denounce the 
     disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' 
     abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes 
     all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographic 
     symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless 
     to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration 
     is entitled <i>The Combed Thunderclap </i>and another The <i>Plaster 
      Cramp </i>and another <i>Axaxaxas mlÃ¶. </i>These phrases, at first glance 
     incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographic or allegorical 
     manner; such a justification is verbal and, <i>ex hypothesi, </i>already 
     figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters </p> <p>
     <i>
      dhcmrlchtdj
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     which the divine Library has not foreseen and which 
     in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one 
     can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, 
     which</p> <p>
     [98]</p> <p>
     is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name 
     of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless 
     epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves 
     of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well, and 
     the same work attributed to another author. (An <i>n</i> number of possible 
     languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol <i>library</i> 
     allows the correct definition <i>a ubiquitous and lasting system of 
      hexagonal galleries</i>, but <i>library</i> is <i>bread</i> or <i>pyramid 
     </i>or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another 
     value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?) 
    </p> <p>
     The methodical task of writing distracts me from the 
     present state of men. The certitude that everything has been written 
     negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the 
     young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in 
     a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. 
     Epidemics, heretical conflicts peregrinations which inevitably degenerate 
     into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned 
     the suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old 
     age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species 
     - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library 
     will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, 
     equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret. </p> <p>
     I have just written <i>infinite</i>. I have not interpolated 
     this adjective out of rhetorical habit: I say that it is not illogical 
     to think that the world is infinite. Those </p> <p>
     [99]</p> <p>
     who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote 
     places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come 
     to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit 
     forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture 
     to suggest this solution to the ancient problem. <i>The Library is unlimited 
      and cyclical. </i>If an eternal traveller were to cross it in any direction, 
     after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in 
     the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). 
     My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope.(4) </p> <p>
     [100]</p> 
    <p>
     (1) The original manuscript does not contain digits 
     or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and 
     the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of 
     the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this 
     unknown author <i>(Editor's note.)</i> </p> <p>
     (2) Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. 
     Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory 
     of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights 
     through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single 
     librarian. </p> <p>
     (3) I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for 
     it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can 
     be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate 
     and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds 
     to that of a ladder. </p> <p>
     (4) Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this 
     vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, <i>a single volume</i> 
     would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or 
     ten point type, containing an infinite number of infinitely thin leaves. 
     (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies 
     are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling 
     of this silky <i>vademecum</i> would not be convenient: each apparent 
     page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle 
     page would have no reverse. </p>
